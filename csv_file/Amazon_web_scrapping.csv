0,"The phone I received was by all estimations brand new. Not a mark on it and fully charged. However, being new to the Apple World, I can honestly say Windows & Android are both in plain, simple, super easy to understand English. Apple is not. Even its keyboard is not a full Standard Keyboard, like it is with Windows & any Google machine. Android is Google, that's why I say it that way. No getting around it. Just keeping it short & to the point. Apple's iPhone keyboard takes extreme amount of effort to use because it is not the Standard keyboard of every other operating system. Thankfully, I was able to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it. Otherwise, it's a serious no-go for keyboard use.As for Apple's iPhone Touchscreen, again, I find it sorely lacking. There's no such thing as the simple pinch & zoom on it. That particular luxury seems to be found only within the Camera & Picture sections. You'd think it'd at least be within the iBook section but it's not. On most everything Windows or Google, every app is not just touch & activate, but also affords the luxury of pinch & zoom as well as easy swipe & easy app close & dismiss. Can't say that about the Apple iPhone.And for some unknown reason its WiFi also keeps turning itself on. I can't seem to keep it off no matter how often I manually turn it off.For Apple being so USER-FRIENDLY, I cannot at all say that it is. In fact, IT IS ANYTHING BUT USER-FRIENDLY.  If the Apple World was so user-friendly, then it would be a very simple and easy transition from the Windows or Google platform to Apple. And I can honestly say it is Not at all simple or easy. I was so hoping it would be as simple & easy as my Windows machine & Android phone, but sadly, it's actually quite maddening.If you enjoy Kindle reads, you'll need to install the app for it. But I can also tell you, Apple's iBook seriously pales in comparison to Kindle. Ironically, the Google Search Engine is installed on Apple's iPhone but Kindle is not. I avoid Google anything & everything as much as can be done. But for Apple to deny Amazon's Kindle Apple on its phones, seems almost a crime.I have yet to install the Kindle reading app or to test out the camera on the iPhone. When I do I'll update my review. But currently I can't say it's anything to brag about. And I most certainly did not expect to see Google's Search Engine/Web Browser on it.Size wise, it's the exact same size as my Sony Xperia Z3v. It still functions quite well. Not perfect, but well enough for me since I have it locked to call, text, Kindle reads & camera.  I can easily read, pinch & zoom & highlight my Kindle reads, pictures & text messages on it. Can only do that with pictures on the iPhone. So for it being so great, I actually find it quite limiting. Not because it's an iPhone, but because the Apple creators decided to create a platform that is quite complex and extremely arduous to use. Apple created its own ""language"" that must be learned in order to navigate the complexities of its Eco-system.  Even now, trying to login to the Apple App Store, no keyboard appears so I can actually install Apps necessary for my personal use. Yet you're required to sign in to it. How can you sign into the App Store when NO KEYBOARD APPEARS TO LET YOU?! So, even if I did not want to use the phone feature, but instead use it as a computer tablet, I cannot because it won't let me login to the App Store. ... Like I said, to anyone new to the Apple world, it's quite a infuriatingly maddening conundrum. If Apple wants to gain new customers and retain them, then Apple needs to change how it operates. And if Apple is supposed to be the safest of all online platforms, then it should not sport Google's web browser.The phone I received was/is like brand new. Operating it though, takes considerable patients as it is quite the learning curve. It should not be so difficult to transition from Windows, Android or Google to Apple. They all made sense to everybody from the moment they came out because they were in simple English and easily understood and simple to navigate because of it. Apple on the other hand, not by a long shot. Even Apple's touchscreen capabilities sorely lacks in comparison. And that's sad. You'd think their touchscreen capabilities would be at least on-par with Windows, Google & Android but it is not. You'd think Apple's touchscreen capabilities might even be better than Windows, Android & Google, but no. Thus far I can find nothing to brag about regarding Apple anything. I was so hoping to find something better about Apple. Instead, I'm greatly disappointed and left seriously frustrated.The iPhone itself came fully charged and appears in brand new condition. It also came with an original Apple Charger.I give the seller a stellar 5 star rating, along with the iPhone I received.I give Apple itself a mediocre 3, even 2 star rating.So to anyone new to the Apple world, maybe an iPad would be easier to use. I started with a phone since I need both a new phone & a new computer and figured Apple would be a serious upgrade to Windows and for sure compared to Google's Android. ... Apple is not at all user-friendly to a first time user. Only Windows, Google & Android can actually claim user-friendly bragging rights, from day one for any first time user.Apparently I need either direct Apple support or YouTube's Apple education in order to learn how to make the best use of this phone.  I don't fault the phone for anything. It's an Apple thing. It's very nearly like you gotta go to MIT to learn it. And that's just not right.Will update as I learn how to navigate Apple's world & extremely clunky Eco-system.1st Time Apple iPhone User Assessment. -Phone - good. - can't give it high marks due to Apple itself.Apple - not worth all the money & certainly nothing to brag about."
1,"I purchased this phone with the intent of having it for a very short period of time.  My plan was to use it as a trade-in since my previous phone was too old to qualify (iPhone 6 Plus).  I purchased the phone for around $250 and got an $800 trade-in value on an iPhone 14 Pro Max, when switching from one carrier to another.  I'd been with the previous carrier for 20 some years but it was time for a change.The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars, is that it had non-Apple parts on it that the new carrier was somehow able to identify, maybe battery, maybe screen?  Perhaps there is some history somewhere of previous iPhone repairs.  Anyway, the replacement parts were determined to be acceptable and the $800 credit was given.  I ended up using the phone for a couple of weeks while waiting for my new phone to come in.  The phone functioned to my satisfaction.I didn't rate the face recognition because after two attempts, I did not get it to work.  My wife said I wasn't doing it right and that may be the case.  I was trying to follow the camera with my eyes when moving the phone around in the circle.  The app completed, be then said I was unable to use face recognition.  The front camera did work, so again, perhaps the failure was unrelated to the phone.For anyone who wants to try to save a few hundred dollars on trading in a phone, this may be the way to go.  As I found out though, there could potentially be some risk depending on the parts used for any repairs made."
2,This is my 2nd used iphone Ive gotten from Amazon. My wife bought 2 as well. I am not the guy that is into getting a new phone every year. I hold on to my phones as long as I can. I pay cash for it vs financing a phone like some do and cant justify spending over $1k on a phone when people sell cars for $1k-$2k. Phones have always worked fine and each one was a fair price. I will continue to buy my phones from Amazon until I get a reason not to.
3,I’ve had the phone for almost 10 months now and honestly have little to no complaints. I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to the XR (yes I know I’m always behind). I’d recommend the XR for somebody who wants to remain in the Apple ecosystem without breaking the bank. Maybe the battery life could be a little better for somebody like myself who puts a lot of hours into my phone. But it’s dependable and if you have a prior iPhone you can set it up almost instantly. Gonna try to make this phone last as long as possible
4,"I asked for my phone to be renewed fairly okay for cheaper, and my phone came in BRAND NEW, not a single SCRATCH, no crack no nothing , speaker sounded GREAT, comes with a charger, and is very nicely package, I’ve bought so many red iPhone XR’s off Amazon from different people and this was by far the overall BEST ONE. Thank u , I WILL use yall again! ✅✅✅"
5,"The phone was labeled as “excellent condition.” I had purchased a phone from Amazon renewed around two years ago, the phone I received then was in near perfect condition with no visible scratches/scuffs when examining. However, I can’t say the same about this purchase. The iPhone XR I purchased from the same seller as before had scuffs around the rear camera casing, dust scratches (probably from cases) and had a few minor scratches on the front. The battery health was a 100% (probably replaced with an unofficial battery). I’m still keeping the phone because it’s an emergency but don’t expect to get a perfect looking phone. 6.5/10.Update: I’m returning this because I’ve found a better looking used iPhone XR from a different seller!"
6,"El teléfono está en muy buen estado, no tiene ningún golpe o quebradura en la pantalla o la parte de atrás del teléfono. La batería tiene un 86% de vida pero es un teléfono que salió al mercado hace un tiempo es entendible, pero todo funciona muy bien, además viene sin ningún bloqueo de línea que es lo una de las cosas más importantes."
7,I have had this phone for a few months now. It has little to no issues. There were no scratches that I could personally see and the set up was super easy. the box it came in was a little sketchy. there wasn't a whole lot of protection around the phone but I mean the phone came in almost perfect condition. The battery life is a little crappy. total charge is at 86% and it does die a little faster than I would like but that is manageable just by turning on battery saver mode. maybe it is just an iPhone thing but some of the apps will say they have notifications but when I go into them nothing shows up. Seeing as this is really my first iPhone I would say its pretty good.
8,"The phone came in a generic box and had a generic cord and wall plug included.  No visible scratches, hard to tell it wasn’t brand new.  Battery had 80% battery life left, which is why it got a 3.  Would purchase again, it shipped quickly and the price was good.  Needed it to replace a broken iPhone14."
9,"The packaging was a concern because it only had the bubble wrap protecting it but …Looked brand new, had a few scratches but not too noticeable.. it also came like 4 days earlier:) also came with a chargerJust started using it so I’ll see how it goes"
10,I was very nervous about purchasing a reconditioned phone.  Wife made fun of me and called me cheap. The phone is spotless and runs great. Call quality is excellent and camera is great. I bought the same iPhone XR brand new a few years ago and gave that one to my son and now I use this one.  The reconditioned phone has been great and is worth the savings.
11,I like it so far I see it fine It’s working very well I but it for my son he like it he haven’t complained the screen the face recognition and battery looks good so far I say if I need another one I definitely will buy it again If I don’t see nothing bad!
12,I went on a search for a new phone when my renewed 8S finally gave up the ghost. I wanted a phone that was functional without the need for glitz and glamour. My son-in-law put the XR at the top of his preferred list. The renewed phone I received from Kiss Electronics exceeded my expectations. It appears brand new in function and performance. Battery life is 86%. I especially like the way Kiss packaged the phone was for protection. It came with a new charging cable and SIM card key. The price was reasonable as well.
13,"Face recognition is very fine, Battery life is not too good just 89% and don’t take too much time without charging. The Screen is fine very clear. The cellphone looks very good, I liked. Looks like new"
14,"Phone is an IPhone X. It looks great, works great when it wants to. It does have an issue called “Ghost touch” which is common on the iPhone X. It opens apps and causes areas of messages not to work, will swap phone calls when you have multiple callers. It is  a pain in the butt!  Phone looks great and works fine 50% of the time.  It is a know issue with IPhones and it wasn’t corrected on this refurbished phone. The other iPhone I bought from them works just fine."
15,"The phone arrived just as described. For a refurbished item, I just noticed a couple small scratches on the back,  and the battery life is 91%. My grandson said that was really good for a phone this old.  So for just having it a week,  I think it's just as good as new for the fraction of the price.Thank you!!"
16,Bought this for my daughter.  She's been bugging me for 2 years to get her an iPhone.  I can't afford anymore $on our Verizon bill so I said no.  Then she sent me the info for this and I decided to take a chance.  She loves it!  I won brownie points with my daughter and Amazon won brownie points with me.  I did purchase the insurance though just to be on the safe side.
17,"The phone seems to be in great condition. The battery life wasn’t however on 100%, yet it was on 89% overall seems like a decent phone I have set it up and I am using it. Let’s see how it goes! Thanks!"
18,This IPhone looks brand new.  Not a scratch or blemish any where.  Takes great pictures too!  Thank you TRADEMORE SERVICES for sending a great phone!
19,"Everything Is Perfect , Works As It Should Performs Ad Should Also , It Came Wen Expected To , Even Included A Glass Screen Protector Already On It & Also A Charging Cable (NoFastCharger) W/The A/C Wall Adapter"
20,"I’ve been an Android user since the beginning but finally decided to switch to Apple based on recent and upcoming Google changes.Very happy with this iPhone XR! I chose this model because it was new enough while not being too heavy an investment.  I was using a MotoZ and this XR is equal in size and efficiency. I also used a Samsung Note10 and this is a bit smaller.  The size fits nicely into my small purse and pockets. I chose the 256GB because I know having a faster phone with more storage matters. Nothing worse than a sluggish device.The face recognition works great and is much handier than using my fingerprint. I haven’t had any issues logging in regardless of how my hair is styled and whether I’m wearing glasses or not.I love the color! It’s more of an orange than red. The camera is faaar better than any of my previous phones, except for the Sony I once owned.This model came with the power cord, power plug, and ear pods making it ready to go straight out of the box. Just needed to give it a good charge before using.Buying refurbished devises has been something I’ve had only success with. I’m always careful and do my research on the seller before buying. Plus I invest in the extended warranty through Amazon plus in this case I chose Apple Care. Money is always a huge issue for me but in this case I won’t buy without the added protection. Phones are too essential not to.Learning the Apple layout and differences has been new but not a struggle. I find the biggest issue is the power button is on the opposite side of the device. For things I haven’t known how to do I’ve used Apple.com and searched Google.It’s impossible to get away from Google completely but at least I know my info is safe now.I would totally recommend this seller and product to friends and family!"
21,"the first thing i will say is directed towards everyone no matter what phone you get, i highly recommended you check EVERYTHING when you buy a used/renewed phone. such as water damage (open the sim tray and shine a light inside you should see a little strip. if it’s white your phone isn’t water damaged, if it’s red or pink, it is damaged inside. id recommended watching a video to help with that as well to make sure you’re doing it correctly) you should also check the battery life (settings-battery-battery health-battery capacity. you should have above 85% imo but amazon renewed promises 80% or higher for normal refurbished, 90% or higher for premium.) you should also check the authenticity of the phone. (settings-general-about-press model number-search up serial number on apple.com. when you press your mode number, the first letter will either be M or some other numbers (google to find out.) but M means this is an official apple phone and wasn’t replaced as a part of apple care+ or etc.) obviously check the screen, display and chipset by either running benchmarks by an app or jus looking it up :) ) i can’t think of anything else to test. so i will say that this is amazing tbh, perfect condition only a tiny nick toward the top of the phone, 89% battery life, for only $240 this is an amazing deal :) buy it if you have the money it is an amazing phone, some sellers may sell bad phones etc so just be careful what seller you buy it from."
22,"I’m excited about this phone,I have to issues facial recognition works fine,battery like is ok and screen quality is great.For a old used phone I don’t have any complaints honestly I love it."
23,"Even my refurbished version of this phone is great! Great battery life, excellent screen and the camera is also pretty impressive. Would order another one!"
24,Love the phone!!! Works perfectly and it was unlocked for me to use!!! Highly recommended to get it from this seller!!
25,Honestly so far so good I got the blue iPhone xr !! I love it. It got here sooner then expected which was a plus !
26,"Everything was great about the phone. It arrived fast, and it works great. I have purchased 2 phones and they did not disappoint."
27,The phone came two days earlier than the expected arrival date so that was a plus.It looks very new and I am pleased with the outer appearance. However the screen quality for the “touch” is on and off. The middle and bottom part of the screen reacts to my finger touching it but I have to tap the screen significantly harder for the top half of it.It comes with the tool to put in your SIM card and a charger.I will be monitoring it for awhile and give an update if needed.But so far 8/10
28,I only had the phone for a day. My only complaint is the battery life. I know it’s used but it feels like the battery dies a little fast.
29,"It’s a great phone for the year, I’ve only had a couple of glitches here and there but nothing major. It’s pretty durable even without the case or screen protector camera quality is great! Love this phone so far. The battery life is okay I received 91 of battery capacity noting major but this phone is a steal for the price!"
30,EL CELULAR LLEGO EN BUEN ESTADO CON UNA BATERIA AL 97 % LLEVO 2 MESES DE USO Y EL CELULAR ME RINDE PERFECTAMENTE TODO EL DIA
31,recibido en muy buen estado. me funciono perfectamente con las telefonias moviles aqui en Panamá. 100% recomendado
32,"Bought this as my daughters first phone so she can easily communicate with us if shes out with friends or even needs to reach us while at school or school events. She's still too young to buy a brand new iphone. Newer Samsung models are much cheaper, but with her knowkedge of how iPads operate and iPhones being more common among younger people, I found my way here to an older renewed iPhone. So far seems to work great. Tiny scratch on the screen but only really noticeable with the screen dark. It's charging at normal speed. Picture is clear and finger movement around its features is smooth. I probably explained that part wrong. All and all I'm happy with my purchase but time will tell. Any issues I'll come back to edit. Hoping i don't need to though."
33,"It was a brand new experience less the original Apple boxes. Like many, should have gotten this much sooner. First time iPhone user and this is just fabulous."
34,I was definitely surprised by quality considering is from Amazon. Great buy for anyone really
35,"Looked pretty new, came nice and clean. However, when I tried using the phone to call, I couldn’t barely hear the other person talking. I searched up a video on YouTube and in conclusion, the ear piece grill part was just filthy. Took a toothbrush and scraped all the shit out, and worked fine.All in all, pretty great phone for the price. So far so good.Battery also came with 100% health, however they don’t really last that long since it’s been updated to iOS 15"
36,Over all a great phone. However when mine came in the battery health was at 81% which for me was pretty low. They do however say it will be from 80-100% so cant complain to much. Still holds a pretty good time in between charges.
37,"I’m always hesitant to order refurbished electronics.  The phone looked like new, has a good warranty, and has worked fine. Best of all , I saved a ton of money!"
38,Brought the phone about a month ago and everything is working lovely. Cosmetic issues are so small they shouldn’t count lbs. Love it
39,I love the screen quality! And switch everything from my old phone to this one was easier than I could have imagined. It was Definitely frustration free. The size isn’t too bad either. I went from a iPhone 7 to this one which is an iPhone RX.I don’t know about the screen protector. Is there suppose to be a half an inch of space all the way around the edge of the phone screen? Idk 🤷🏾‍♀️ I am an otter box lover at heart. So I’m nervous how this phone will hold up in this case.
40,"This phone was in such great condition.  It was an unlocked phone, so had no problems activating on Verizon, just inserted Sim card and went through the set up.  Awesome buy!"
41,"I was a bit nervous getting renewed but I'm on a budget and I had to buy this plus the Apple Watch 6 for health tracking purposes. There is absolutely no scuffs, dings, or scratches. The only way you can tell it is renewed was battery life was about 89% Which isn't horrible. It still lasts me the day and as this isn't brand new, I'm not dinging a star for that. (Plus I believe that is better than advertised)This along with the watch were my first ever Apple products. I previously had a Moto Stylus and a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Watch. I wanted a watch that would alert me when I had an Afib episode, which the samsung didn't. A lot of afib patients suggest Apple watch for this, which meant I needed an Apple phone.The battery, even new, I don't think would have outperformed my Moto but that's a thing Moto is kinda known for is their big batteries. But as mentioned before, it lasts me all day.I LOVE the blue color. I bought a rugged clear case from local store so that I could protect it while still being able to see the pretty color.Had zero problems putting Mint Mobile on it, so unlocked as promised. Never used an esim before so that was really neat.The apps are amazing and far more varied than Android. That night time wind down is no joke, but I like it. It really is great at making sure I don't pick up my phone and just mess around after bed time and I like that it gives me a little warning so I can go read or do something to wind down for bed.Display is clear and nice.Performance is snappy. A little sad there's not a headphone jack but that's pretty typical these days. Just nice to have something for when your earbuds run out of juice. But it synced upOverall, I know this phone is a bit older in 2022 but I honestly feel like it's almost better than some of the flagship Android phones that are new at a lower price. Overall, I'm really happy. It's really helped become a health tracker as much as a phone. I'm getting why people like Apple now and will probably buy more apple products in the future."
42,Very happy with this purchase. Came in excellent condition and extremely well packaged. Fully satisfied and recommend this vendor.
43,The phone is really fresh n looks brandnew. It works very well and I am pleased. Only issue is battery life but that is all iPhones
44,Loved getting this fantastic phone at a great price after dropping and breaking mine. Arrived quickly and phone is in excellent condition.
45,Phone came looking perfect and working great it was a little laggy but its worth it. Unfortunately it started to glitch BAD after having it for a year or so. I had to get a new phone but overall it worked for the time i needed it to.
46,"Phone is perfect but only flaws I see is a gray rounded line on the corner of the screen not always visible, and the battery health is 81%😞 replacing it soon."
47,At first it had me thinking it wasn’t unlocked because it wouldn’t work with my carrier and it was saying phone isn’t allowed. I did my research and found out it was my carrier that was having the problem and not the phone itself. I absolutely love it 😍 and it came just as described by the seller. I’m am very pleased and would most definitely refer them and buy again if I need to.
48,"The phone arrived quickly and in great condition. I took the SIM card from my old phone and restored the new one from backup. Took a few hours mainly due to the IOS update from Apple prior to restore. By morning it was all done. Screen, camera and buttons all work well. Much better than spending a lot of money for a new phone I really didn’t need."
49,"This iPhone was in amazing condition no scratches on the device whatsoever and it also came with a Glass screen protector as an added on plus! Also provided in the box was a Sim card ejector device, new charger, and wall socket plug. Amazing price and amazing product great seller!"
50,"It is a really good phone camera quality is good and I got in easily. It took 15-20 minutes to get all the updates uploaded,I haven’t seen I thing wrong with it I recommend buying this phone"
51,Si todo funciona bien
52,"I ordered two recommissioned iPhones to use when travelling.  They arrived promptly, beautifully packaged. Exactly as advertised, they even included screen protectors. Thank you"
53,"Everything on the outside seems perfect despite some slight scuffs along the edges of the phone that a phone case easily covers and micro scratches on the screen that you don’t see unless the screens off and you hold it up at different angles.My main concern has to do with the battery Amazon had installed into the phone, as soon as I set my phone up, I got an alert claiming the batter may be in-authentic and in-turn, will affect my phones full capabilities.The only reason I’m being generous on my rating is because I think the issue has more to do with Amazon than the seller.Amazon is sending me a new phone and I’ll be updating my review as soon as I get the new one in the mail about 12-15 days .Update:The only good news  I have to report is that the phone arrived sooner than the 12-15 days they said it would take…The bad news is, the replacement I received was in worse condition than first… The second phone arrived to me and the first thing I noticed was the front speaker and filthy it was. There was so much dirt and crud caked into it, that it was stark white .. I could just tell by looking at it, that it was going to effect the sound quality which it definitely did (I even tried cleaning it but it was cemented in there). I started  to wonder if they even inspected the phone at all because they claim to clean their phone’s  thoroughly so if they didn’t even notice that, and then I went to turn the phone on, the battery was already completely dead which is already a bad sign because you’re expecting a “renewed” phone to have all new parts meaning it should have been almost fully charged … so if the replacement phones battery was completely drained, how would they have looked at it to even inspect it unless something was wrong with the battery that caused the phone to drain while it was shut off but then that circles back to the inspectors again and them not properly doing their job. if the battery was faulty, they should have caught it and fixed the issue before sending it out…once the phone got a charge, I did notice that  I wasn’t getting any alerts about the battery being in-authentic like the first phone did so I believe the 2nd phone still has all its original parts but then it shouldn’t be considered renewed…  the phone also took a really long time to charge and as I mentioned, the sound quality was horrid.I just hate this cat and mouse game of having to send phones back and forth and having to reset them and transfer all my date over and over again so I just decided to suck it up and keep the first iPhone I got and pray it works out because I’ve read stories of Apple locking users out of their phones if it’s believed their phones have in-authentic parts including batteries. I’ll try to remember to give anyone who wants to know, an update in a month or so."
54,Bought this for my daughter she loves it!!
55,I bought a IPhone XR product red it was good got me a simple mobile plan which was 25$ but 1 side of the speaker work but the other 1 does not and it came which a screen protector but it breaks Pieces day by day the battery capacity is 82% although I bought excellent condition I’m am disappointed but other than that it amazing ❤️ I would recommend it

57,Regalo para mi hijo adolescente...

77,"I had no problem with my phone , battery life is good n so is everything else. Even got it early in the mail."
78,I liked the phone in general

84,"Replaced my husbands,  soon to be obsoleteiPhone 6S with iPhone XR. So far it is working great and easy to use. Face recognition feature is awesome"
85,It pretty much felt like I got a new iPhone. There were a few very small minor scratches on the screen but they weren’t very noticeable. Functions fine and didn’t see any problems with it.
86,took about a week to get but my verizon sim card worked fine all functions are as advertised and condition was better than expected
87,This was a great gift for my daughter who uses it now. It has a warless charge and there are still cases out for this product. It has effective facial recognition unless there is any added objects to the facial area. It even recognizes the face when it is dark by using the light from the phone. If it fails it automatically transfers to the pin screen. It does not have finger print recognition. The hotspot connections is very strong and as long as there wifi access there is hotspot access to a similar degree.
88,"The battery dies way to fast, and it is at 98% battery life"
89,Good phone all n all
90,"This is my first phone purchase in almost a decade. I am going from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone XR.I asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iPhone. I have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed. I was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so I gave it a try.So far I am happy with my purchase. The iPhone is in like new condition with no major scratches. However, there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen. They are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the LCD screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phone.When it comes to the actual phone itself, the big screen, sound quality, and fast processor are something to smile about. Apple outdid themselves with this phone. The only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design. I find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand. I think there is an adjustment period. The phone was incredibly easy to set-up. I just had to back my old iPhone up to iTunes and then restore that backup on the XR.I do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has 64g storage but this can be overlooked. (I know that I also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack I just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this item.)Pros-Great price. Fast shipping time. Sold from someone trustworthy. Honest listing and as described. Came with screen protector and SIM removal tool. The phone indicates that the battery life is at 95%.As a phone, great quality overall. The LCD screen is big and bright. The sound is fantastic. The processor is super fast (I think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphone).Cons-The phone came with a knockoff charger not an OEM (original) Apple charger or headphones. Yes, using an Apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference, look into it if you do not believe me. Fortunately I have my old Apple chargers. The screen has a couple miner indented scratches. My finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when I record videos. The audio gets blocked or becomes scratchy.I made this review as detailed as possible because I greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phone.One major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue. I think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone. When you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency. For a couple of hundred dollars more I could have bought straight from Apple, but I am happy I got to save that money."
91,Came like brand new ! & unlocked ! You will not be disappointed!!! Highly recommend!!
92,over all is excellent
93,"It’s great, really, but I got it with the battery running at 86% capacity. I’d return it to get it fixed but I need it pretty badly. I’d recommend checking for that part first before anything else."
94,"The phone is In perfect condition, no scratches or cracks any wear. I’ve had no problems with this phone so far. Definitely would recommend!"
95,"Phone was delivered a day early, in great condition, just like new. Works great so far! Definitely worth the price!"
96,"Everything works perfect. Looks really good, only couple scratches. Totally worth the money!"
97,N/a
98,I love this phone it looks freakin brand new! Trust me! If you having second thoughts with this company DONT! the phones came super fast and it wants damage and it was super easy to setup
99,"Me agrado, pero no pude utilizarlo"
100,Phone looked and worked like it was from the iPhone store
101,Bought for my daughters birthday and she is very happy with it. Works great and looks great.
102,"The phone was over all great, only one scratch on the side but other than that it was fine, came with a charger (not a speed one) and it has an 89% battery compacity. Would definitely recommend buying"
103,I would like to give more attention for package (like back cover and screen protector)
104,i like the phone
105,"I had used an iphone 7 for years.  Upgrading was a steep learning curve for an old person,, but, I'm muddling through just fine."
106,Bought this for my daughter to use for back to school and to replace the old iPhone 8 Plus she had. Came in better shape than expected. Excellent condition cosmetic and internal. Battery life over 85%. My daughter is so in love with this phone. Thanks for the exact description and great quality. Will definitely be purchasing from this seller again.
107,"When I received a reconditioned iPhone XR I purchased last week, upon turning it on, I saw a small number of apps on the screen, which should not have been the case. I then found it still had the previous owner's iCloud ID assigned to it. I don't know if it was a return and the person had neglected to sign out their ID, or what, and it somehow got placed back in stock without proper examination. In any case, because it still had that other person's iCloud ID assigned to it, I was locked out of doing anything with it, so, exasperated, I returned it with an explanation of the problem.With much hesitation (because of many complaints by other reviewers as well as my own experience), I subsequently placed an order for another reconditioned iPhone XR. When I received it and turned it on, with much relief I saw the multi-language ""HELLO"" screen, meaning, at least, I should be able to proceed with entering in my own iCloud ID. The iPhone didn't have a scratch on it and it looked brand new (for that matter, the first XR I received also looked brand new). In fact, when I checked the battery efficiency state in the one I just received, it indicated 100%, indicating its newness.I have a flip phone that has a very inexpensive yearly rate that I use for the rare times I need a cell phone, so I didn't want to buy a smart phone just for cellular calling. I bought this iPhone XR, not to use as a phone, but to use as an intermediate tablet between my iPad Mini and my iPod touch. The iPad Mini is too big to fit even in my cargo pants pockets, and my iPod Touch screen is too small to do anything serious with it when I'm away from home. This iPhone XR is great for that purpose because it fits in my pocket and it is a usable size.  I also like some of the other features, such as the touch features, and even the lack of the home button. I am quite happy with it. I have a WiFi hotspot to use with it, so I can do just about everything I could with a cell-connected smart phone.I thought of giving a three star overall rating because of the experience I had with the previous iPhone XR, but I like this one so much I am giving it five stars."
108,Just as described. Love it! Came fast
109,It was awesome just a few paint scratches I noticed and that was it
110,"No scratches, case or screen. Battery health at almost 100%. Outstanding delivery with secure packaging."
111,iPhone.  XR. Batterie.  Last as long. Time
112,"So when I got the phone and opened up the very plain white box, Inside was the phone (wrapped up very nicely) and it also came with a charger brick and a charger, which is very nice! I was afraid to turn it on after reading some reviews and after I booted it up and set up my apple ID I am very pleased with my purchase so far! Haven't put my sim card in yet so we'll see how that works and I'll update everyone once I use it for a bit!"
113,"The battery dies pretty quickly, I don't use a phone as much as most people. My android before would last about two days this one lasts maybe 6-7 hours.I bought the phone along with an otter box and screen protectors and after the second day there is a crack right across the middle, Not sure if its the phone screen or screen protector yet but I have been very gentle with it, hasn't been dropped or slammed once but it clearly didn't matter.Other than that it's what you would expect from an iphone"
114,I’ve had the phone for a few months and haven’t had any issues
115,My techy 18 year old loves it!
116,N/a
117,This iPhone XR is exceptional. Looks practically brand new. No scratches on screen or body. Hard to tell that it was refurbished. Battery life has also been outstanding. Wouldn’t hesitate to purchase another one in the future.
118,Battery came at 94% usage felt new. No damage at all. works just like a brand new phone. The only ting missing is the unboxing experience. it came bubble wrapped but that doesn't really matter.
119,The phone was practically new. It was worth every penny. I will probably definitely order again from this company.
120,"I will say I was pretty nervous to order this phone with looking at the reviews but the phone works like it’s brand new I had no problems setting it up, it works really well I wouldn’t listen to the bad reviews because this phone is just amazing.(also I had no glitches or anything that the bad reviews were saying)"
121,Excellent iPhone that is in almost new condition. The only sign of use was the battery which was still at 89% charge. I highly recommend it.
122,Perfect Condtion!
123,I’ve had this phone (iPhone XR) for a few months now I have waited to write a review. Problems. It had at 85% battery life. It’s been the best phone. I would highly recommend
124,Great purchase
125,My son loves it. It did not lose its battery capacity since I bought it some eight months ago!
126,"The phone is good, but the charger that came with it has a shortage in it, (even though it was wrapped like new). I’m impressed at how fast it arrived; one-day delivery as opposed to waiting a week. My emails are not all syncing, though. So far so good. Hoping for the best!"
127,Just functions like new
128,I literally loved everything about it the seller was really fast to ship and it does connect to boost mobile
129,"Face recognition good, screen quality good but battery life is the worst. The phone dies so fast. The USB card serves no purpose"
130,I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE. I AM GLAD I UPGRADED.
131,Phone was like new other than the battery. No scratches or scuffs. And it already had a screen protector on the screen. Battery health Was 81%. Would have preferred it be a little better but can live with that. Overall satisfied with purchase.
132,First time ordering refurbished phone. Overall so far so good.
133,"Excelente calidad en este producto, es renovado pero la calidad del teléfono está bien, Face ID funciona debidamente, 91% de batería, me tenía intrigada que decía parent pero resueltó ser lo mismo, la pantalla no tiene ni un rasguño, vino con su cargador, celular unlocked como lo promete el producto. Encantada con este celular"
134,Phone looks and works like brand new.  No problems at all getting it signed into ATT account with new SIM card.  Very happy!
135,I used the product for home and work I have a Sansom galaxy that has better battery life but the battery life is not too bad on this phone
136,The phone still works great and I’ve dropped her at least 30 times pretty rough
137,battery gets too hot to hold phone
138,9/10 phone condition . Iphone came with a few scratches on the camera and back. I really dont like how the battery life was already on 88% . But still a good buy.
139,Works like new and no problemas
140,Well refurbished product
141,"Id love to post photos of the product but a good review is just as good as long as I don’t sound a bot lol. Only thing that I can say that was annoying was the 40 min update it took. Other than that the back and front glass was flawless, no scratches. Only on the sleep button and volumn buttons but not noticiable. 9/10 rating let’s see how it acts with the SIM card in."
142,This phone was to replace the broken phone he was using.
143,"En excelente estado, estéticamente 10/10, funcionalmente por ahora 10/10, gran compra"
144,"I have never bought a used phone. And was really skeptical about buying this one just because I was worried that it would have scratches and wouldn’t work right. Wow, was I wrong. This phone is like New. I can’t find one thing to complain about. I mean Nothing. It’s perfect in every way. I Highly recommend buying from this seller.  I am so happy that I’m going to buy another one from them tonight. I just got to pick it out. Thank you guys/gals Very Much!"
145,This my 4th phone I have bought from the company and I never a problem with none of the phones!
146,I bought this for my husband and we have not had any problems with it so far
147,"It was easy, fast, the phone was pristine and I will be ordering again from this seller"
148,Solo tiene unos detalles en la parte de atrás que no se miran solo bien de cerca. Por lo demás está intacto me encanta!
149,I was having phone problems while away at school and my phone stopped working I ordered this one and it came really fast! I have had no problem with it since! It was definitely worth the purchase
150,I like the phone. I bought it as a gift for my mother. But the first one that I ordered from Amazon was a dud. Amazon says that it checks the phone thoroughly. But that was not the case. The phone had a broken face ID sensor and I had to go to apple store where they confirmed me that. I replaced it and got another one.
151,Received the phone today and it looked brand new. Took it and had it switched to us cellular without a problem. Battery health was 86% which isnt horrible
152,I absolutely love my first iphone just like NEW!
153,very good battery lifw
154,Se recalienta con poco uso y llego con batería del 87%
155,"Battery life was 80%, and screen was scratched in a diagonal line.Obviously it’s used and it’s kind of the luck of the draw, and I absolutely love the phone besides that"
156,"It says it refurbished, but the phone I received is in brand new condition."
157,"Amazing phone , my grandson love it"
158,There were some scratches on the screen
159,I love this phone.No issues.
160,"Everything was perfect about the phone except the battery life. I got it on about 86%. Other than that it looked brand new, not a scratch on it and it even came with one of those protective glass thingys."
161,Bought this for a gift. Came with the charging box & cable no head phones. The phone was good quality except for a few scratches on the edges. Overall worth my money
162,Esta bien
163,"I received this device and it came in brand new physical shape. No cracks, no scratches, nothing. That being said, it came with 88% maximum capacity in terms of battery life, which gets the job done! Keep in mind (for reference) my previous iPhone was an iPhone 6plus that wouldn't last more than 15 minutes without dying. So if you have a really old phone like I did, this company will hook you up with a nice phone for a reasonable price. I've been using this XR for 2 months now and the quality has not changed one bit. I understand some people may experience worse but better yet you may get a phone with over 90% capacity left, it's almost a gamble! But they guarantee over 80% so trust them. If you have a really old phone like I did then this will be the best $250 ever spent. I plan to own this phone for the next 2-3 years at minimum because it works almost like new. Props to these guys!"
164,"Estéticamente 9/10, muy bueno, batería 89% dura todo el día, volveré a comprar de este vendedor"
165,"I dropped my phone on tile and shattered both the front and rear glass.  I was quoted around $300 to fix it.  I decided to check Amazon and found this seller that had the same phone and storage (renewed) at an excellent price. I took a chance and I am glad I did.  The phone works as expected.  The charging cord did not work properly, so I sent the seller a message & they replaced that promptly.  Great experience., highly recommend."
166,Really cannot complain my battery on my iphone 6 was needing two charges a day. this ten needs it every two days and is bigger. There are some strange phantom circles on the screen when I open it but other than that great and does not cost $1000+
167,Person received it with a smile and is very happy with it
168,the battery life came at 94 and the phone came like new phone no scratches no nothing looks amazing and everything works perfectly;) this is my first day using it if they are any problem further on  I will be sure to edit
169,Works like it should looks brand new.
170,Everything worked as stated. Love this phone and the color is amazing.
171,"Great Quaility , almost new !!!"
172,No me agrado q la batería estaba en 82 esperaba al menos 85
173,"I purchased 2 red phones for my kids. One worked and is still working with no issues.However the second one had internet connection issues, would not verify with Apple servers when going through setup,  and would not update to the latest IOS. I returned the phone for exchange,  in hopes they updated the IOS before shipping the phone this time.  The return like the original order was via UPS. However they are sending the replacement via USPS which is taking forever to get to me. Kind of a not nice thing.Thankfully Amazon fixed the return.Update:Received replacement phone today,  it updated to new OS with no issues at all. Really wish these places updated their devices and fully tested them before sending them out."
174,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I also forgot to upload the photos and the battery was like at 85% but it does say that in the Description. Plus the phone came really fast it’s like three days so my day that’s fast they ever say Amazon deliver something. The thing I noticed was that little small spot in the screen may who did the repair touch it right there when they fixed but other then that I love it
175,I bought this renewed iPhone XR I am very happy with it I would recommend Amazons renewed products I’ve had it for over a year and a half and it’s been perfect no problems whatsoever. Definitely worth the price and gray quality.
176,"Ordered an iPhone XR from the seller , phone was in great condition. Battery life was used but as expected 87%. Camera lens screen did seem to have been replaced or repaired or just had small scratches on the outer end of it . Other than that the phone arrived a day earlier and in the morning which made my day . I wish I had bought two but i will definitely order another once back in stock . Also came with a charger and power box as well as the sim remover tool . Did not come in a iPhone XR apple box but I don’t mind but it did have well packaging with bubble wrap around the phone and also a bubble wrap package . Phone and charger were in a white box with room and felt secured . Im happy and satisfied with my purchase as it’s been one of my few times ordering from Amazon ."
177,Bought for my daughter.  Battery is at 90%. Had a screen protector on it. No cosmetic damage to phone. Happy with it!
178,I love it
179,Funciona como nuevo.
180,"This purchase is a dandy.  Seriously, if I didn't know better I really would think the phone is new.  Everything about it screams ""new"".  I've had it for going on two months using it many times a day with absolutely no problems.  The face recognition is uncanny.  I walked into the bedroom in the semi-dark, looked at my phone, and it lit up.  The battery always charges to 100%.  No scratches on the screen and the images are crisp.  The price was great.  I would buy from this seller without giving it a second thought."
181,needed to upgrade and storage capacity.
182,"This phone is great there is no issue with it at all , just a little scratch nothing much..the battery maximum capacity is at 84%."
183,The phone is so cute
184,phone arrived perfectly.  It was a good buy.  which makes refurbished phones help recycle their useful life again.  my mom loved it so much.  and the product arrived with 93% capacity.  but overall similar to a new one.
185,I have used the phone a month there have been no issues.
186,My daughter has wanted an iPhone for so long she finally has one and she loves it
187,Nothing
188,Just need my money back
189,"UPDATE: the phone now works it took over a day to get the phone updated. I had to turn it off instead of trying to let it load on it’s on. However, the phone works perfectly fine, has long battery life, great face recognition, and did not have any scratches on front or back screen I would most definitely recommend if looking for a reasonable priced iPhone.I have been trying to set up my phone however it will not download the latest IOS unless the screen stays on and the Wi-Fi turns off each time the screen goes black and you have to have Wi-Fi to install it. Overall it does not seem like a bad phone but it is extremely slow and a little irritating it shouldn’t take 2 hours to set up a phone. I am debating on sending this back for a new one"
190,Got this phone for my son and he loves it.
191,"I’ve had an XR since it came out, and I really love it. BUT it crashed; and I wasn’t interested in upgrading. Cue Amazon renewed. I had a good experience buying my daughter a renewed phone and also a kindle paper white a year ago, so I thought I would give it another try. This XR came in LIKE NEW…not one single mark on it ANYWHERE. You wouldn’t know that it’s a renewed device by looks, or how it runs. Battery health is 99%. Zero issues setting it up. It also came with a screen protector. So happy with it!! Shipping was also super fast. All 3 renewed devices I’ve ordered were literally all like new. I definitely would recommend Amazon renewed if you need to replace a device and don’t want to drop tons of money on a brand new one."
192,It’s value and it’s high-quality
193,Im really impressed with the quality of the phone and it arrived a day early. Super happy with my purchase! Nothing at all wrong with it
194,"The device seems ok, I've only used it for a few days now but no issues so far. While I do understand this is a refurbished device, the screen has a few deep scratches and the charging port is dirty. None of those affects the devices performance."
195,Works fine. Excellent t condition. Good price. Quick delivery
196,Very happy with purchase. Works and looks great. Will probably buy from this seller again.
197,"So everything seems to work as intended, it’s unlocked and works on my carrier. Battery Health is at 91% and lasts me almost a whole day. Face ID works and is quite snappy. Came with the 128gb that I ordered. Both the glass front and back came with very minimal and hard to see scratches to none, However the the frame is a little damaged as described near the screws on the bottom and some small marks/ dents near the back glass also some etching on the frame (some kindve wiped off, some will not) from a plastic case? But it’s in a case most of the time so it doesn’t really bother me too much! Camera works well and takes good photos. Screen gets pretty bright and is crisp, but as it being a replaced screen it doesn’t have True Tone functionality. The buttons literally not there. All the physical buttons work and don’t get stuck. Just know if you’re coming from a pretty slim phone like a 6s plus or similar ones, you’ll be shocked with how thick the XR truly is. It comes with 3 gigs of ram, which in todays standard sounds very small but the phone manages its ram decently well. Of course if you have a lot open and you’re switching apps it’ll rarely restart an application. If you’re a mobile gamer it runs mobile legends great, PUBG is pretty good. Ever so slight lag when joining a match and that’s pretty much it, I haven’t tried cod mobile but it runs Minecraft smooth if you’re into Minecraft."
198,Very pleased at how new the phones look and how they come. This is my second time ordering a phone thru them and both times the phones have been amazing.
199,Both phones work phenomenally and I’m about to get one more for my daughter
200,The battery life was at 93 and the phone works like new thank you guys so much I will be buying more from this seller
201,Para el precio me parece bastante bueno
202,"My phone came in today and I was extremely disappointed with the cosmetic conditions.  After finding out my phone should of had little to no scratches and nome that are visible from arms length , I decided to pay the extra price for an excellent condition phone, and received a phone with more than obvious damage as you can see in the pictures that every single corner had multiple chips and scratches that were very visible, and the worst was the Crack in the back of the phone in the glass that's about 3 inches long and very noticeable which makes the phone in fair condition rather than excellent.  Please explain this to me after I've been a loyal Amazon customer I feel like I've been for sure lied to and scammed. I just need this to be made right by your promises."
203,I purchased this phone for my grandson.  He has no complaints so far.
204,"there is a small white dot on the bottom of the screen, it does not appear on the home screen or the passcode screen, what is it?"
205,"Face ID works well, screen was slightly cracked on arrival not sure if from shipping (wasn’t packaged very well in a loose box). Battery life at 82%z"
206,"The Good:The phone is fast and responsive.  Apple provides many nice useful features and utilities.  The camera is very good.  Face recognition works great.The Bad:Battery life isn't very good.  Neither is the screen resolution.If using this phone with wifi calling and there is no cell data, the phone will usually not receive mms messages that include pictures sent from Androids and you will have no idea these messages were sent to you.  Sometimes they will load when you go to a 4g area, but not always.  Same thing happens with voicemails.  The fact that a phone (and it is the phone, not the carrier) will lose text/voice messages is intolerable and unacceptable.  Apple is aware of these issues.Another inherent issue with Iphone is when using a web browser and you want to watch a video on a web page, the IPhone will not play it.  Instead it will open a new tab and download it.  Apple is aware of these issues but hasn't rectified them.  And because of that I plan to return this phone, abandon IPhone, and go back to Android.If going from Android to Iphone, be aware that in addition to the issues above, you lose some very good features, such as the ability to use an microSD card for extra (and removable) storage, a 3.5mm audio jack, and the ability to easily web search images via the camera.Other thoughts:My premium renewed phone came with 92% battery.  It arrived in great cosmetic condition.  The battery doesn't quite make it through the day, and that is with moderate use.  Due to a combination of battery life and known issues that Apple has refused to resolve, it is time to head back to Android.  Hopefully you have better luck."
207,"Bravo. I got the Renewed Premium. It came at 93%. I had an issue at 4 months, but amazon took care of me. They made it right. The phone is worth it. I am so impressed by their warranty and their willingness to commit to the customer. Y'all do the RENEWED PREMIUM. Great things to say. I am so impressed, and I feel validated by their commitment to make me a happy customer. Their guarantee is to take care of you, and that's exactly what they did. They took care of me. Get the phone, get the plan, and if you have issues have them call you. It took me literally 2 minutes to talk to someone.  BRAVO!!! YOU ROCK"
208,Needed a new phone after my previous iPhone broke. It arrived a few days earlier than I was expecting which was nice. Came with 85% battery life which is not bad. Works really well and I haven’t haven’t issues with it so far. I will update in the future if anything comes up.The face recognition works OK but doesn’t recognize me without my glasses on or in poor lighting.It came well shipped and did not have any major scratches or screen cracks.The screen quality is really good. My aunt said she liked it better than her current iPhone 13 Pro but I’m not sure aha.
209,Very good condition
210,Phone came with a charger. Phone works pretty well.
211,No compliants
212,I’m beyond impressed! Used and functions well 👌🏾
213,Me encanto
214,Everything was fine
215,time will tell
216,Works perfect
217,Great phone look like new and everything works
218,It works!!
219,"I received this phone as a gift for my mother about a week ago. So far, it's a good phone. The phone looked brand-new out of the package. I was slightly concerned after powering the phone on because I believed I saw a faint shadow on the sign-in page. However, after we updated to the latest IOS, no shadows, and no issues.  Very happy so far."
220,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I order a iPhone XR red phone, the first one came in and it didn’t even work, they did a replacement phone and the button on the side for the volume and the power button is not functioning like it needs too. Sending time and money and you want something to work"
221,"Product as described. No obvious defects. Battery at 100% capacity. Also important to me is the waterproof feature. Accidentally dropped into the sea twice, but the phone still works great."
222,goof value
223,Phone works well and was in decent used condition no complaints there .  But the 3 star ⭐⭐⭐ is for the seller's choice of shipping. While USPS might be a cheaper option it's a less reliable option and a bigger hassle for the buyer to recover the package.Over all good product just hope the seller would consider a better shipping method.
224,"It’s decent the only thing bad about it, is that it has a scrape around the camera"
225,"For anyone who doubts this product, I definitely recommend you to buy this, I was also afraid of a restored phone, but I got my phone yesterday and you know what, it has a warranty for another half a year, it was not opened, I checked it and it had all the details native, and do you know how much battery wear was? 0%, yes, this phone is absolutely clean, new, just without a box, everything works, I'm delighted, thank you for such work, I will still order when delivery to Russia is restored, it's still difficult to organize through relatives in Europe and it turns out to be expensive in finances, all good purchases!!!"
226,I ordered this phone and when I got it it looked brand new. There were no scratches or dents on the screen or the phone itself. There was some wear and tear from a previous case but not noticeable unless you specifically look for it. So I bought a new case and covered it up and you can’t even tell the tiny imperfections. For the price of the phone I would recommend this company in a heartbeat. When I got this phone the battery life was at 89% and the battery lasts me almost all day (9am-8pm)  I will definitely be looking for my next reused phone from them.
227,Still great colorful iPhone.
228,"I put in my old sim , which is in perfect condition. I tried putting out and in but still didn’t connect, I reset the phone and still didn’t connect. Kinda having the feeling it’s blacklisted🤷🏾‍♀️ But other then that it works fine"
229,I am very happy with the product . Thank you
230,Todas estas funciones están funcionando muy bien
231,"I bought a renewed premium, and it arrived with only 87% battery, in addition to the sound of the call that came with problems"
232,I bought this phone for my son. It arrived a day early and he couldn’t be happier.
233,"I bought this phone to upgrade from my aging iPhone 7, and it arrived earlier than expected, and in nice packaging. The battery health was 91%, but it lasts a whole day without needing charge. The phone came with no physical damage or blemishes, and no scratches either. The camera works great, too. But the one thing I was most nervous about was the function of Face ID, since the iPhone XR doesn’t have Touch ID and has no other form of biometrics. However, upon arrival, it worked perfectly and still does now! The screen and haptic feedback both work great too, and for $330, I am very satisfied with this, and I cannot thank you enough. (:"
234,I bought this iPhone for my son and he loves it. It charger is an A plus the screen is nice the face recognition is super cool
235,Best phone I’ve ever owned
236,"iPhone XR 256GB, White, Unlocked07/2022 - It's been two days since I received the phone. So far so good. Genuine Apple product. Genuinely unlocked. Everything works as far as I can tell and I genuinely can't see this phone was refurbed, which is shocking since its white. But it's freaking pristine. Like new. The only indicator is that the battery health is at 91. I'll come back after a while and update this review just to let you know how it goes.09/22 - It’s still working great! I’m typing this review on it. I don’t think it’s gonna change lol. Quality phone 👍"
237,Not bad
238,Bought this last year in September. Fast shipping and the phone still works well no glitches and received in perfect condition. I did buy a different from from Amazon and that one only lasted 3 months. I do recommend getting the warranty because you never know how long this phones will lost. I did get lucky with this purchase and it was a good deal.
239,Arrived quickly and it looked new
240,"The phone looks new, it's difficult to tell that it's renewed. I love it!!"
241,"Got this phone about two months now and it works great. It was my first time buying a refurbished phone and I was really skeptical but I was proven wrong. The only thing is that the battery dies after it reaches about 15% but then it charges up to 100% and it lasts for about 8 hours with regular usage. I had to buy a fast charger separate as it came with a regular 5 watt charger in the box. This was my first time buying anything from Amazon Premium. I am happy to have the year warranty on the product. Everything works well, Face ID, camera both front and back and the speakers are excellent. The phone came with one tiny scratch on the side but it’s unnoticeable and plus I always have a case on. It is also my first time with an iPhone and it took some time getting adjusted too. I honestly find Android was a bit more user friendly, but I am happy that I tried it."
242,"Great phone, excellent condition. Arrived on time however, I couldn't get the phone activated to my service. This is the only reason I'm sending the phone back for a full refund. I have been trying to get it activated since May 26 to no avail."
243,"Update: 04/06/2021: I still have this phone. Still works amazing. Battery lasts me all day even at 50%. Works like new. 100% worth every penny :).Update: 10/27/2020: My phone still works the same way it did when I got it even though I’ve dropped it and mishandled it a few times :)Update 03/14/2020: This phone still works perfectly. I don’t carry my charger with me during the day anymore. 64GB is a perfect amount of storage. This phone has frozen up less than 5 times since I got it. Screen still looks great (I cracked it but it’s working) and everything is still fast and accurate. I’ve had no issues. This is the best phone I’ve had in a while. Also the camera is amazing and I’ve come to fall in love with it. (I’ve attached a picture I took with the phone below)My phone is amazing! Obviously I’d show it if I wasn’t on it right now. I waited a few days before making this review so I could make sure no quirks popped up.First of all this is the best battery life I’ve ever had on a phone EVER. I went out for 8 hours and came home and my phone was on 74% at the end of the day. Same thing with school. My phone was at about 50% at the end of the school day. Now it charges pretty slowly in my opinion but the slow charging is definitely worth the battery.Size wise the phone is pretty big. It is a handful to hold and hard to throw in my pocket. The screen size is beautiful for watching videos and doing digital stuff but the phone is just a little big.The software works perfectly. The touch is fine, Face ID is incredibly fast and accurate, and it opens apps very fast. It also responds really well to my touch. My last phone did not.The speaker is amazing. It’s so loud that I didn’t even need my speaker in the shower. The phone was loud enough by itself. I took a call in a room full of noisy kids and my dad said he couldn’t even really hear them. So they cancel noise. Microphone is good. I can say “hey Siri” quietly and it’ll activate.Overall I’m really impressed. I was very nervous looking at other reviews but my phone is working so perfectly right now. I am definitely satisfied especially with paying $200 less than apple was charging.Then again I upgraded from a cracked 6s so that could be the reason I’m so over the moon haha"
244,I received a used iPhone XR in very good condition. Looks like new.I am very pleased. I would buy from Amazon Renewed again.No problem.
245,"Llego en perfecto estado a excepción de que alrededor de la cámara trasera tiene una ligera falta de color pero no se nota mucho , funciona perfectamente la pantalla esta en Perfecto estado, la bateria llego en 89%  pero funciona muy bien. Yo recomiendo buscar un buen proveedor con buenas reseñas y ya 👍"
246,Great phone. Got the excellent one. Works great.
247,"Great phone, but came with signs of use on the screen"
248,"The Xr was one of the best iPhones under $350. Mine arrived in two days, physically in MINT condition with zero signs of use. Battery and screen are original, and battery shows 92 percent capacity, zero issues activating on iCloud and accepted my Mint SIM with no trouble (was listed as unlocked). 128GB of storage is more than enough for most users.I am very happy with this phone as it replaces an 8 with a failing battery. The Xr will still be supported for at least 2 more years with iOS updates, and I had no problem updating mine to 15.4.1. It runs fast, and does everything I need a phone to do without being encumbered to some extortion/rip off installment plan which is nothing more than a glorified contract of adhesion that the telecom cartels LOVE.Buy your phones like I did and save, not be tied down to a service plan, and enjoy a great phone that was obviously well tested and refurbished to like new for a couple hundred instead of a thousand (or more)."
249,"Received with a battery life of 90%. Everything is functioning too, so I’m happy with my purchase."
250,Size is good. The phone is at speed
251,Quick service; excellent quality. Thank you
252,"I am happy with the phone generally, but quickly found that the phone speaker is not clear and it’s hard to understand the people I’m talking with at times. Sending it back."
253,Best phone
254,The only issue I had was if I’m on the phone the screen goes black and won’t come on to hang up the call. I thought of returning it but since I text most the time any way I decided not to. The screen will come on when the other person hangs up.
255,Makes a reasonable gift for average intro to tech user.-thepointejamaica stay with us
256,Good
257,The phone looks brand new! Works perfectly!
258,Muy recomendado ya llevo 2 años con el I la verdad no eh batallado con el 100 % recomendado
259,I ordered this phone a week ago and overall the phone works really well the condition was really good and I highly recommended it
260,I've had mine for two months now and it works great. Everything came in a nice box with the charging cable and the power brick. The phone itself was in a good condition and I've had no issues with it so far. Definitely recommend.
261,"I really like this phone and have had no issues with it thus far. I was a bit skeptical about it being renewed and all, but it came in very good condition and without any noticeable damage. For additional reference, I have also used this phone with both big phone companies and third parties that use their towers without any problems."
262,                    The media could not be loaded.                 This is a good purchase though the battery life is a bit low.
263,"Screen quality great, battery health came at 93 and facial recognition works. Impressed with the quality of a refurbished phone"
264,The phone looks too old and used up. However it looks like it is working for now. I will use the phone and see how the performance is during the trial period. Peace of mind since it has 90 days return policy in place. No need to rush to make decision.
265,"I ordered one with 256GB Not 128GB storage, kindly can you review it and replace the order."
266,"Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black - Unlocked (Renewed)Based on the reviews, there's probably some luck of the draw involved, but the phone I got was like new. Battery life is better than my last iphone when new. In five weeks i've been unable to find an imperfection. The display isn't as highly rated as newer/more expensive models but I knew that when I got it. I got a great phone and saved a bunch of money. I'm extremely happy with the purchase."
267,"Was skeptical at first but my hubby convinced me. The phone came quick, looked brand new.  was easy to insert my sim. So glad I didn’t buy a new phone from apple. Saved a ton of money. Only complaint is the Verizon charger that came with it stopped charging the phone after about 2 weeks. Otherwise a great and smart purchase!"
268,It was affordable and came in a great condition I love it I turned it on and everything because it is a birthday gift for someone and the screen looks nice and clear and everything
269,"The only problem I had with this phone was, the card that came with it said I could just put my old sim card in this phone and it would work, but I had to call my carrier and have them activate it for me, other then that the phone works great, No problems so far!"
270,I like this phone the quality is pristine. It was packed very neat
271,Phone looks very good . Works well . Would recommend.
272,En buen estado
273,"Phone was in perfect condition conditions,battery life 100% thank you"
274,I recieved the iPhone xr 1 day early. It had only a few nixed places on the back of the phone nothing that the phone case cover. The screen had 1 little scratch. The battery is like new. My granddaughter is enjoying her new iPhone. I would recommend this phone.
275,Received my phone on time with not a single scratch
276,I had an iPhone 8 and this iPhone XR is what I’m using now. It takes good pictures and I like it well. It didn’t cost much.
277,Always thought it was stupid seeing weight for phones. I was the stupid one for not paying attention. This is way too heavy.
278,EXCELENTE INVERSION.
279,"My five year old Android phone was still working great but a lot of apps were no longer working on it.  I also wanted to use my phone to fly a drone I recently purchased but again, my Android phone wouldn't run the necessary app.  I've enjoyed the various iPads I've purchased over the years and thought the time was right to try an iPhone.Because I was leery of spending a premium price for a new phone (or paying it over time with my phone plan), I decided to purchase a refurbished and unlocked iPhone XR.  It came with everything needed as well as a screen-protector which of course didn't go on terribly well and was eventually discarded.  I did have to purchase a case to protect the phone but that was a minimally priced extra purchase.I'm very happy with the phone, its features, its great camera and all its functionality.  Setting it up wasn't as simple as swapping out my SIM card and required some intervention on Verizon's part to set up properly. Within a day, I had a working phone and I'm very happy with the purchase so far."
280,This is the second renewed iPhone we bought from Amazon. The first try is bad with battery at the first day of using then we switched to this one. Quite happy with it by now!
281,The phone works great the battery life is good and no cracks .  Best phone I had gotten on here
282,So this is my third time buying a refurbished iPhone on Amazon and first time with this seller. I just cannot justify buying a brand new iPhone for a pay as you go account. It came looking great and works like it’s new. I know it’s a gamble buying iPhones on amazon but as long as you check reviews and read through the lines you should be able to tell which sellers are legit.
283,"My family recently upgraded to iphone13's, but I soon left mine on top of the car (while trying to make room for an unexpected passenger), so that $900 (!) item was destroyed on the freeway (when it finally let go of my roof). I feel so fortunate that Amazon gave me a big discount on this new phone (since I got an Amazon credit card, to save something like $125) AND the phone came with unexpected gifts: screen protector & elegant case!  (The case is not as strong as what I'm used to, but I love not having the headache of having to buy two more items.) THANK YOU, Amazon!I am afraid the battery life & camera aren't as awesome as the new iphone 13's, but they're still way better than the iphone7 I left behind (which was working okay after 5 years of ownership, so it's sad I killed a new 13 so quickly, in my haste to give a friend a ride home one night, unexpectedly)."
284,It came with a 100 percent the battery is kinda glitchy it said it was at 15 then it went to 17 without charging it has a max capacity of 85 which kinda sucks it’s just 3 above the normal capacity your phone should be to not die fast it looks real and came in a good condition so it’s a 4/5
285,I ordered this phone 4months ago so far the phone is great! Recommend.
286,No scratches or marks looks almost brand new. Batter life is 90 percent but overall fair price for the phone and 60$ insurance
287,Shipping was fast phone looks brand new. I’m very satisfied. The volume the picture quality.. everything.
288,"No major scratches, great face recognition, battery life is 85% wish it was a little higher,  it has some weird lines in the back of the screen when the phone is on light mode you can see it. Otherwise from that Great buy 👍🏽👍🏽"
289,"Only flaw is a small white out on screen. Seller offered to refund money 100%, but I chose to deal with it for now and maybe have fixed later. Other than that really satisfied with purchase."
290,"i actually got this phone last thursday and just thought to write a review. it came thursday morning and it has no dents minus one on the side thats barely visible, so a better condition than my iphone 7+ thats also refurbished. i’m still getting used to no home button but its super pretty and in near perfect condition minus a few things. there’s a weird spot on the apple logo i can’t wash or try to scratch off with my nail so that annoys me a bit. sometimes the screen has a weird rectangle appear in the middle of it thats a brown tint but it only appears when the phone is 20% and less. other than those two things, the phone is perfect and i really dont see myself upgrading my phone anytime soon. i’m not gonna say don’t trust the negative reviews like other people said since people can take a gamble if they trust their guts to try amazon renewed and these things tend to have a 50/50 on working out. also it came with a screen protector so i feel a bit better about this pure glass phone lol."
291,this phone looked brand new
292,It was a really good product. Loved the camera quality and the newness it had to it but the battery life was really a turn off. It had a 75% battery life
293,Good condition work very good
294,It runs great had a amazing screen and has okay battery life face recognition is a little funky but it dose work tho all in all a good phone for the price
295,Over all great. Came with a screen protector. Battery life is not as good as my Xr I had to replace but still last a day of work till I get off and recharge it on the way home to last the rest of the day.
296,Everything works great. All set up with my provider and  no problems!  Great value. Would buy again
297,"I got the phone 4 days early and it came in a box but was not a Apple box and but that was disclosed in the description so I was expecting that. It also came with a charger the wall box was black but still had that new plastic wrap on it and the cord was white like a normal iPhone cord. It came with a paperclip and directions on how to set it up and a number if you needed any help(I didn't use it but it is appreciated that it was there). I switched my SIM card over and set up took less than 10 minutes including the iCloud transfer and overall was very easy. The phone got here early this morning and I have been using it since the battery came a 72% and its now almost 6 pm with battery still left. My phone says it is at 94% battery battery capacity and considering my old phone was at like 53% I consider this a major upgrade especially since the description says the battery capacity will come above 80% and I got one with 94%. It came with a screen protector and the front nor the back was cracked and I don't see any signs of scuffing around the edge. The screen works extremely well and its buttons and charging port are all working properly. I hope everything stays the way it is especially for the price. I think its like a brand new phone and have had no issues so far, if anything changes I will make another review or edit the one I made."
298,"The phone came on time and works great, but the speakers have something wrong with them.They sound worse than a car radio. I would suggest getting a new phone because this was a risk I took and didn’t end up enjoying it."
299,"I will usually only buy from HYBRID IT. They are the safest to buy from in terms of getting a phone without much or any damage. I’ve tried unsuccessfully to buy from backmarket and the sellers there , but it’s very hit or miss. I’ve had phones with tons of damage show up and been very disappointed. So I purchase usually exclusively from hybrid it on Amazon. Their prices are a bit more than their competitors, but the phones come in like new condition most of the time.This XR I purchased looks very new, but I am really disappointed by the battery health. It’s 80% which is as low as you can go on Amazon. For reference my husband purchased an XS Max from Hybrid and the battery was at 96% . 80% means I’m putting another $100 out at Battery Bulbs Plus to replace it within the next month. So that’s disappointing, but I guess that’s the gamble."
300,"It may take months or a year to see if the reconditioned quality is good. Phone arrived fast and looks brand new - no scratches or other problems. Came with cord and USB/AC adapter. Does NOT come with the touch pen shown in the picture. Does not come with SIM card. Camera seems all right. Vibrant color and clarity. The audio is great - voice quality on calls is very good when set on speaker. Music and video sound are excellent, too. The battery life is good - lasts longer between charges, considering I am listening to audio books for hours. Compatible with Credo Mobile. I got a great discounted data plan with savings that will make up for the cost of the phone.The only reason I upgraded is that my eyesight is aging, and I need bigger screen. That said, the XR screen  isn't as big as the brand new models, but it's an improvement over past models. The 6.1"" phone doesn't fit well or balance in my hand like the old 5s or SE. I have large hands, but the phone is awkward to hold and heavy compared to older models. Functionality is fine, once I turned off most the extraneous or obtrusive OS features. I haven't figured out how to disable the emergency SOS. You need to look at the screen when turning the phone off to make sure you don't accidentally swipe it. Also, I miss the Home push button on older models. I've had the phone a week and already hate all the swiping. I never liked Siri, so I am stuck with swiping."
301,I wish I had known about buying iphones this way a long time ago. Price is amazing and the phone is perfect Like New condition! I will never buy another phone from the carriers again.
302,"I waited three weeks after purchase to write this review. Because I wanted to give an honest an proper review. When the phone came it was in great condition, the phone charged perfectly. And even though the facial recognition software is good it is flawed but not the device itself. I have noticed that the screen lags a bit, I have to turn the phone upside down in order for it to work sometimes. This doesn’t happen often but it does happen. Outside of that the phone is great and I’m glad I purchased it from this company."
303,My son love’s his new phone & the quality is great. Came with a nice charger too
304,My expectations were met.
305,"el envió por FedEx, fue un pco molesto, no llego a mi domicilio y tube que rastrear el paquete hasta la oficina FedEx donde estaba el paquete. pero valió la pena, porque el celular esta en excelentes condiciones, si rayones, ya lo utilice por una semana y no me  ha dado problema, lo recomiendo."
306,Very impressed with the quality.  One of few purchases that was what it was said to be.
307,"The phone works as should and quality is not bad as well. However, I was unable to connect my phone to any Bluetooth devices as the phone would not pick any of them up when trying to pair. I contacted the seller and went through troubleshooting steps which did not fix the problem. I was told to sign out of the phone and send a screenshot to prove I was signed out and they would send a return label for a replacement. I’m not exactly sure the relevance of this. Return label was sent and I was asked to send proof that the phone was sent back through postal service. I’m not sure the relevance of this either as there is a tracking number on the return label. I respectfully asked for a $20 credit as I would now have to pay two activation fees with my carrier (which actually turned out to be three fees as I needed to reactivate my old phone while waiting for the replacement to come in which equals out to $40 extra I should not be shelling out). I was told they don’t know what an activation fee is, that their phones are all unlocked, and to send proof of the activation fee and they would research it and make a decision. I’m not sure what planet these people are from but it’s definitely not here.. Do better.Update: I sent the proof of return to this company and now they say they don’t have this phone in stock and will refund me once they see the condition of the phone. The worst company ever."
308,"Got this for my wife, she love it, and the battery is still 100%"
309,"My wireless provider does not offer monthly plans on phones.  Two of our phones needed an upgrade and for the first time, we turned to an unlocked renewed iPhone option for its affordability. We are glad we did!The activation was easy via our provider website and/or their application. The shipping was faster than expected and this seller uses a reliable courier company. The condition of both phones were excellent! It was a great experience and we are grateful that we found this opportunity to upgrade for performing and quality phones at an affordable cost as they came in great condition. We would not hesitate to buy again from this seller.  We enjoy our new renewed phones very much!"
310,Battery 89% not bad
311,The condition is somewhat plausible. Everything about it is great! But battery life is a necessity. At a whopping 82% battery health. I could say it can be better. Also came with a broken back glass and non functioning left speaker. Still a great product for its price! The phone still works amazingly well!
312,Mine arrived with some scuff marks around the camera and a cracked screen protector but other than that pretty good item and works normally
313,"The battery life was surprisingly very good, considering this is a used phone…the condition of the overall phone was very good. So far so good, and would definitely recommend"
314,Honestly there battery life is great and they phone is amazing
315,Arrived in a dqy. Very surprised at the condition of the phone. The battery was also at 95% which was not excepted also. I will do business with amazon again now v.s ebay for all my iphone shopping. thanks amazon renewed!
316,I got this for my son after his last phone was broken. This was a cheaper option than our local refurbished phone store. I was nervous about the quality but we received a nice phone with no major marks or anything. There was like a tiny scratch on the corner of the screen when held at a specific angle it was visible but not bad. Everything else has been fine. I like that you can return in 90 days if anything goes wrong. The pricing was good and I keep asking my son if there is any glitching or anything and he says it’s working fine. I will probably order my next phone on here too.
317,This phone is really awesome I love it the only problem I will say is the battery life I guess I was expecting more with the battery health but it not a big deal other from that it is amazing
318,I like the size. I do not like the sound quality.
319,Received my phone unlocked from the seller quicker than advertised. Minor scratches on case but the screen looked almost new. Came with a screen protector installed and a battery health of 96%. I was worried about ordering a renewed phone but the experience has been great so far.
320,This was a good purchase overall. The phone looks brand new and works well for the most part…. But every once in a while it does somewhat weird things. The screen sometimes freezes while I’m using speaker phone and there are times when I try to watch a video on FB or TikTok and there’s no sound at all. I turn the volume to the max and still am not able to hear anything. I have to close the app and reopen it to fix it.
321,Ordered the iPhone XR fir my daughter. It’s her first phone so we wanted to get something inexpensive to see how she handles it. Phone came faster than expected and is in top notch quality. I don’t have anything negative to say about this purchase. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a bargain. I will definitely be purchasing more items in the future.
322,its great ive had the phone for a week now at first i was worried i was going to be scammed but i wasnt would definally recomend
323,Just the best phone ever! Great size! Great camera!
324,"Everything loaded fine but the ear speaker was weak and distorted, upon inspection the speaker screen was plugged. As a certified MDR tech I cleaned the screen as pictured did not get perfect without removal. Then found that the lightning plug socket was lint packed and required cleaning.  Now it works great."
325,"I've been struggling with Android for years trying to save money over Apple. Finally I had had enough and decided to get an unlocked iPhone XR 256 (White) from Amazon (Renewed).What can I say?This phone is awesome. It's fast, it's all-screen, it's unlocks and logs into things using your face. It's solid. Sound quality is great. I feel like I'm using a REAL tool and not a toy.It does't detect very weak cellular signal well, but it doesn't drop calls either. I don't accidentally hit the mute button like on my old iPhone and Android phones.Battery life is good, but not great (about a day and a half with light usage). Downloads are LIGHTNING fast (50MB in less than four seconds over my 175mbps broadband). It downloadeded my old Zen Pinball tables almost instantly.What I don't like:No headphone jack. Back is glass and easily slides off furniture and tables (I keep finding it on the floor). Volume buttons are on the left side instead of right.Everything else?Perfect. This phone is a pleasure to use and Amazon sells it at about HALF the price of new retail. Battery Health was at 95% when received. No cracks or scratches. Generic crappy power connector included (but who doesn't already have 50?). No headphones included (big whoop).If you want to save some money and get a REAL phone this one is a winner."
326,Came in like brand new except the battery 🔋 life like 80% but it’s ok it was good price and all for a gift 🎁 to someone.
327,I was a little worried at first bc of the reviews but i got the phone and it looked brand new minus a few scratches that i could barley see. the battery health was at 100%. i just got it today so if anything happens i’ll update.
328,"Very good condition, everything works perfectly, very good steals and deals"
329,This phone looks and operates flawlessly.
330,"We were very skeptical buying a refurbished phone but the phone came and it looked brand new and still runs brand new. Came with charger , not in a apple box but that was not an issue for us !"
331,Phone came in today is in amazing condition hopefully I don’t run into any problems along the way I almost thought it was a new phone had no scuffs or scratches well  recommend you buy forget the negative comments.
332,The speed of shipping in this item was awesome. I live in a rural area and two days shipping is a stretch sometimes. This item came next day. I’m very pleased as this is as good as new plus they shipped it with a screen protector attached. I highly recommend!
333,"This is the first Apple phone I've ever owned or used. I'm still learning to navigate it, but so far it's working well. I got it to use for my 360 photo booth business."
334,"The battery life was 79% and it’s disappointing should be ware when buying it, for how long more U can use it than keep it all the time on charger…."
335,"i’m not sure if it was because i ordered right before prime week or if i just got lucky but i got here the next day. like exactly 24 hours. the phone was in great condition, the charger they sent with it is literal heaven. buy from these folks, it’ll be worth the money !!!!"
336,"Product is guaranteed as ""- This product will have a battery that exceeds 80% capacity relative to new.""However, the product I received had a battery health of ""significantly degraded"" and ""service"". Battery's maximum capacity is only 71%, not the guaranteed exceeding 80% value.Phone is scratched somewhat badly on the bottom.Screen seems fine.Will see if replacement is possible. I'm assuming this product is frankly just hit or miss; you might get a decent phone or you might not. It does not seem they actually check to make sure the guarantees are there; they just make them up and hope you don't check. Make sure to check your phone's status immediately.UPDATE: Phone dies at around 95% battery life. It will not turn back on until charged, in which case it will immediately be charged to 90% battery life and repeat the same process (essentially, the phone only seems to have 5-10% battery life available). Severely degraded phone. Returning immediately and purchasing a new phone."
337,"Iphone XR is cosmetically like new. Everything seems to be working as expected, and my 14 year old son seems very pleased. Screen has no dead pixels or scratches and the battery life seems on par with a device this old. Would buy from this seller again for sure."
338,It works perfectly
339,"Bought this for my father in law who is coming from a 3 year old Android phone that was on its last leg. The iPhone XR was a huge upgrade and I was pleasantly surprised that this particular ""renewed"" device had good battery life, and not a scratch on it. Maybe I lucked out, but would buy it again."
340,"Was pretty bit unsure about ordering a renewed/refurbished phone so took a gamble an surprisingly was worth it got my phone pretty quickly which was a surprised, came in a very strange box an before i went to work but taking it along with me i did my little review an i gotta say i got lucky phone was in almost perfect condition no scratches or wear, mine came in as 90% battey health, was Unlocked an no i didnt order premium but glad i took a gamble. Glad i finally upgraded to something better besides my iphone 6 plus, if theres problems with yours you can always send it back an get a hopefully better one in the little brochure it comes with but yeah 5 stars"
341,"Everything looks great in box. It has 89% battery life, minor scuffs on corners. No cracks. But the screen is most definitely aftermarket. Colors are far from good. Other than that its a cheap phone that will get me by for awhile."
342,"Never mind the package, which is pretty good. The phone is in pristine conditions and it works perfect. Can easily pass for a brand new phone. Cable and charger, included. No hustle purchase, fast delivery. Will definitely consider for near future phone replacement."
343,Phone is ok speaker is bad
344,"Phone came with some dings around the edges, camera lense also has dings around the edge. Battery health came in at 89%. Otherwise works fine so far."
345,I loved the color and quality. I was able to set it up in a little over and hr. I’m overall very happy with it!
346,"I bought this for my 14 years old daughter.  Here is her review:I've had this IPhone for over a month now, and I have determined that buying a refurbished IPhone was a great choice to cut costs, and it's great for the environment as well! We bought from the seller 'MOBILESUPPLY'.Accessories: The IPhone came with a lightning cable and a power adapter that were not manufactured by Apple, but they were still compatible with the phone and worked just fine!Appearance: I could not see any scuff marks or any other imperfections on the IPhone (though I am not an expert).Battery: The IPhone came with 91% battery capacity (which means that the battery could hold 91% of the charge that it could hold when it was new). It can still last for 1.5-2 days without having to charge if I use apps that don't drain battery fast (such as games and Youtube).Setup: Everything was easy to set up, I just needed to log into my ICloud account and set up Siri, face ID, etc, which were all very simple. There was none of the previous owner's data on the phone.Use: I can download apps without any issues, and everything runs smoothly (no lag, glitches, etc). Face ID works very well, and the audio played from the phone's speakers sounds great!I hope this helps!"
347,"My cousin ordered for her bf at the time.. he broke up with her, she should’ve just left his ass phoneless"
348,"The experience was a bit worrysome, since the product description was inconsistent through different parts of the shipping process.iPhone XR Coral Amazon Renewed - what I added to the amazon basket.iPhone XR Coral Amazon Renewed, with image of black iphone, Sold by Verison - what was in the order details.iPhone XR ""New"" from Verzion - what was listed on box and pamplets shipped with product.iPhone XR Coral - what I received.Product was in great condition.  I popped in a TMobile sim card from my old phone, and data+text+calls worked without any special provider configuration."
349,Bought this for our son. Battery drained easily. Something was wrong with the speaker as well. We are returning it.
350,it’s basically a brand new phone. doesn’t come with a charger tho. works fine. no cracks or scratches
351,The battery life that it came with was 84% so I would say it was pretty good. Although it did come with like a medium sized scratch on the screen but it’s was nothing that a screen protector can cover up
352,My hubby loves this phone. Nothing to flashy. The screen quality is perfect. Has very minimal scratches around camera area. That was ok with me. Will update later on battery life.
353,To heavy and keeps automatically switching out of 3g and lte to the lowest data option. Good camera.
354,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 It’s been about a week since this phone was purchased and so far, there has not been any problems with the phone. It works perfectly and does its work fine! I tested the camera, phone call quality, speaker audio, bluetooth connection, and etc for any malfunctions and there was no issues. The phone itself was in decent condition, as shown on the pictures, there is a small chip on the top right corner of the phone and some chipped particles on the camera that can barely be seen. I had no issues with the chipped corner since it was really small and can easily be covered with a phone case! It came with a charger that I personally wouldn’t use since the charging speed is slow, but other than that it is a great phone! I would recommend if you want to save some bucks on a decent phone for regular use."
355,I like this phone working very good recommend save money
356,"I ordered two of these phones. One looked brand new and worked great. The other phone had an issue in that the internal microphone did not work. The phone worked with a headset, but not without. I was able to exchange it right away. The replacement looks and works great. Good customer service after the sale. Quick and polite messages from the seller. I would recommend this product, and this seller."
357,"Took SIM card from old phone , put it into new one. Went through manual set up. That was it , everything works fine. Very happy"
358,"It was a gift for my mum, way better then her old iPhone 6. She loves it and I’m happy I purchased this🔥🔥"
359,loved the battery life and the camera quality
360,It was great for a phone of Amazon a little dirt around the camera but still great
361,"Mine came with 91% battery life along with a screen protector. It’s definitely a good deal if you want a good phone for a cheap price. In addition, XR will get a few more years of IOS update, so if you’re looking to upgrade, it’s best to get it now."
362,Phone was in good shape and works great
363,"Great phone for a great price. It's been a couple months and it's working perfectly. No issues, but batter life seems a little low. Not sure if that's an issue with the phone or with my daughter, though. Charging cable it came with also wasn't working, so I had to buy a new one, but that's not a big deal."
364,4 stars from me1.I got it activated through metro pcs2.No obvious dents or scratches3.Works fine for now4. Speaker sounds wonderful and the camera quality is better than the iPhone 6s5. A very fair deal6. Set up was very easy7. Came with charger and nicely sealedI don’t have any complaints
365,Perfection
366,When i make a call the line is broken at times that i can hardly hear the other person
367,The phone worked good but they wouldn’t connect it for some reason. My issue is that I shipped the phone back and never received my refund.
368,"Perfect phone, Perfect seller! So happy with this purchase, would definitely buy the same phone from the same seller again. Exactly as was shown and described on Amazon and the seller was way helpful--Thank You!! Highly Recommend! 5 stars A+ 4 Paws Up!"
369,                    The media could not be loaded.                
370,"Almost everything about the phone was perfect. When I first got it, it didn't come in fancy box or anything just bubble wrap and an extra charger and block. I really don't care about how fancy it looks just that it kept my phone safe. It did just that. I was able to log on and type well. The facial recognition but after a few days of having it, the touch screen started acting weird. It would not let me type for a good five minutes then work again. The screen has no scratches or cracks. It looks like it if from the inside that is messed up. Overall,  It is a very nice phone."
371,"The Phone is B- grade, some scratches on the screen and the sides... good condition."
372,All in all I’m happy with the phone
373,very nice
374,"This phone is amazing so far. The seller I chose was Decluttr, and they delivered perfectly on this product. I've never owned an iPhone before, but this seller made it a great first experience.If you're considering buying one of these iPhones, remember to choose the right seller wisely. I chose Decluttr because they had high reviews and great shipping, and that decision was pretty good for me.On the phone itself, there's little to no scratches or scuffs on the phone, and it works perfectly. The battery I got was at around 90%, which is the only thing I can really complain about. But besides that, this was a great value phone. Definitely recommend it."
375,"It’s like a brand new iPhone but the battery you can tell has been used, I would recommend buying a replacement battery."
376,"The phone came in great condition, came unlocked like I ordered, No problems at all."
377,"The phone is amazing in quality, features, and use for such a refurbished and renewed phone. However, the only issue may be the phone overheating after consistently gaming or using it after a couple hours."
378,"Renewed iPhone XR 64g - February 2022Here is my Amazon review:Delivery was excellent, received tracking later that day and received phone 48 hours later via FedEx. Came securely in a generic box, with generic accessories, and free screen protector (missing the SIM card adapter). Visibly on back of phone it was very noticeably scratched up but no scratches on the screen itself.  It was easy to set up and was unlocked as advertised.  Maximum Battery capacity is 85%."
379,Came with small cracks submitted it never heard back
380,"The delivery was fast and reliable. The earpiece was faulty, though. Had to replace the phone. The replacement came in just fine."
381,Works great but not unlocked as it said
382,Muy bien
383,Excellent condition but battery life was a little low and speakers sounded distorted
384,"Me gustó mucho, la entrega fue perfecta y el teléfono se encuentra en perfecto estado. La batería tiene bastante vida útil y el precio es genial"
385,The face recognition is always on point and detects me even in the dark with my screen being on dim most of the time if there was anything I could say that’s wrong with it is that the curve at the top where the camera is located sometimes gets in the way of videos I’m trying to watch but other than that it’s pretty good
386,Work like brand new no issues.
387,Was was working perfectly its almost been a year simce and i have no troubles
388,"I got it 2 days early and I love the phone. It's my first iPhone I've gotten and I enjoy it. I have cricket wireless and it works fine. Battery was good, cameras are amazing. Lcd display is good, no cracks and mine came with a screen protector. No earpods but it's fine. Charges fine. Everything you need from a phone, this give. Amazing product"
389,"Just got mine today and so far I love it! Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, maybe just be mindful of which supplier you pick. I got mine from All-Out Mobile since they had 95% positive reviews. It is backed by amazon guarantee so it’s sort of risk free, although it would be a hassle to try to return it. They did send me a different color than what I ordered, but they tried to contact me and let me know and I missed the call which is my bad so I’m not docking any points for that. They just sent me a white one, and who really cares about the color that much since you’re most likely gonna put a case on it anyways. There is also a couple very minimal scratches on the side but it is refurbished after all so I wasn’t expecting perfection. It operates flawlessly and it shipped so fast I literally got it in like 2 days, which I really appreciated since I completely broke my old phone and I need a phone for my job. It does come with a charger, just not an original apple one. No headphones though. The screen looks great and the sound is awesome. I’d been using an iPhone 6 for years so I’m thrilled to have an upgrade. Overall really happy with the purchase, and will be ordering another one for my fiancé!"
390,"Came to me with 86% battery health. I’ve been using the phone for about 2 ish months now. There are no scratches on the glass, there was one small dent at the speakers, and the screen quality and software are perfect. However, a very small portion of the glass seems to have been melted, best I can describe. It doesn’t affect the functionality or feel of the screen, and you can’t even tell anything is wrong unless you hold it a certain way in the light, but it’s significant enough to make it pretty much impossible to use a screen protector without a big bubble appearing under the protector no matter HOW you apply it. Also, the front facing camera also seems to be a lower quality than I expected(it still works fine tho). However, even with that deformed screen problem, it’s just about the best device I’ve ever owned and it looks and feels almost new and it’s very fast."
391,"For a product this cheap I was hesitant especially given all of the bad reviews, BUT the device I received met my expectations. Minimal scratches on the aluminum casing, no scratches whatsoever on the screen or back glass. Battery was sitting at 91% health, so already pretty good. No issues getting setup, honestly would probably buy again."
392,"ProsThe Battery life says 91% but it charges to 98%It was unlockedI liked the colorI came to this from an LG from 2009 and I am very impressedI can see why people like Iphones so muchConsOne of the speakers is non functionalI wish it had fingerprint instead of facial recognition, I don't use that.It's very slim and I'm nervous about damaging it accidentallyNavigation is different, not really a con but felt it worth mentioningMy hands and wrists get uncomfortable pins and needles if I use it too long, this does not happen with my Nintendo Switch"
393,The phone was cracked and it's taking a long time to do the software update it's been 52 minutes.. And the phone does not want to charge
394,Child really like the face recognition on the phone.
395,"I bought 2 of these iPhone XR's.  My sons was great, he had it up and running in just a few minutes!I didn't have the same luck.  First the unit was scratched... (I had never purchased anything ""renewed"" so that was a surprise to me... ) it also had a sizeable crack/dent on the lower right corner... which was also a shock.  But I figured that is just how refurbished phones looked... the camera looked pristine...and that is why I wanted a newer iPhone model... so I was okay with it.The trouble started when I was setting up the phone... this sucker started getting HOT!  I thought it was because it was being activated... or something... again... I have NEVER purchased a refurbished phone... so I had no idea.  Then after set up... I was done using it.  I sat it on my nightstand and didn't think about it again.When my daughter called me later that afternoon, I picked up the phone... and it was HOTTTTTTTTTTTTT...  I mean iron your clothes hot...  I asked my son if he was experiencing the same thing... and he was not... I asked my daughter if any of her iPhone had ever burned her hand... her answer was ""no"" as well... so I had to return the phone...as something much be wrong with it.I went to print out my return label... and noticed the seller has written that all returned phones with incur a 15% RESTOCKING FEE!So you're telling me... YOU CAN SELL ME A DAMAGED PHONE... AND GET $40-$50 bucks PROFIT?So there is NO incentive to EVER care about sending out good products?That could be a second stream of business all to itself... sell a damaged phone... get money on the return... rinse and repeat!  I WILL BE FIGHTING THIS TOOTH AND NAIL!  This is OUTRAGEOUS!"
396,"Needed a bigger screen as my XS was too small and was having trouble keeping up with my workload. Phone works great, came with no cosmetic damage and 85% battery health. Only some hardly noticeable micro-scratches on the screen. Overall a great price and well worth the upgrade."
397,"Everything about this phone is just amazing ! I was soooo scared to order at first but I literally scrolled thru all the reviews and was just like why not ? And I’m glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews I’m so glad I didn’t ! Just got my package today I was sooo nervous to open it but when I did I was amazed at how it came in there’s not one scratch or dent or any other damage you would describe on this phone ! Screen is pretty sensitive if you ask me and the camera is beautiful ! Oh and it also works with cricket guys so I’d definitely get it unlocked if you’re a cricket customer like me :) also I just wanna say I brought this from seller MyWit , very good service ! And I would show vids or pictures of the phone but I’m obviously on it now lol just kno this phone is in great condition almost as if its really brand new . Battery life is good too . charges up pretty fast if you ask me and the phone does last awhile I doubt you’d even need a charger to go anywhere with it and also I see how some reviews complain about how it doesn’t come with headphones .. but obviously if you read about the phone and what the seller says about it you’d see that it stated no headphones comes with the package but best believe a charger does ! So yeah I’m glad I didn’t listen to the negative reviews even tho I was worried everyday that I was waitin for my package to come . Other than that I HIGHLYYY RECOMMEND buying a phone from here !"
398,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 This phone has been the best thing I have ever bought. Screen works well lovely color Face ID works perfectly NO SCRATCHES is what I loved the most out of the phone. This phone came with 90% Battery (which is okay but I would loved to have more than 95%). I have read reviews but all the reviews come from different sellers I got my straight from Amazon (Amazon Renewed Premium) which was a little more money than normal Amazon renewed which was so worth it I have had it now for more than 4 months I would say and it has been great. I give it a 4 star because I only had one trouble with the phone at first I could not connect my SIM card in to the phone, I went to my Carrier and the checked if it was lost or stolen (which it was not) and were able to connect my SIM card. Overall this phone has been great for myself I love it great camera, and many more thank you Amazon."
399,"i ordered a white phone and came in red but i still kept it. but despite that, phone works super well and totally worth the money"
400,This product is NOT compatible with boost mobile. Do not listen to the people in questions and answers tab. Please not return on the product takes more than a week to return.
401,Ordered the red unlocked it came as described you can tell it is used came a little dirty the speaker grill could have been cleaned out and there were a few chips along the frame but again it's a used phone for a good deal.  Was unlocked connected just fine to metro by T mobileEverything seems to work great so far
402,"I am on a limited budget so when my iPhone 6 finally bit the dust (dropped it and shattered the screen) I chose to get a refurbished iPhone because I can’t spend a grand on a new phone. This phone came to me in pristine condition and everything works just fine. Swapping everything over from my old phone was so easy. I compared the prices to Walmart and they’re about the same, but I’m more comfortable with Amazon since this is where I do most of my online shopping. I’m satisfied."
403,I was so nervous to buy this phone because of some reviews i just got the phone today but everything so far is great condition and working wise great so far
404,"I am extremely unsatisfied with this purchase. I am hoping “HYRID-IT” I think the company is called, fixes this issue and makes good on their product, and I’d happily update this review if they attempt to do so. I have purchased many phones off of amazon’s market place in refurbished condition, 3 iPhone x’s, and 1 XR, and have NEVER had this happen until I got the XR.The phone was working amazing when first received in November of 2020, it is now august 14th, 2021 and it has died. YES IT LITERALLY DIED. Plugged the phone in to charge before bedtime 2 days ago, and when I woke up the screen never turned on again. I am extremely disappointed. I literally feel like I was stolen from I spent over $300 for this phone and had decently high expectations considering my success with other iPhone purchases in this marketplace; and unfortunately I am feeling as though I am high and dry now. I left the seller a message; I am praying they can do some kind of exchange; even if it involves me going a bit out of pocket, will see if they care enough to even respond. If they do again, I will update this review.***Update, HYDBRID IT MADE THINGS RIGHT."
405,"I will admit to being more the a little nervous ordering a used phone with some of the reviews I read. Those that were negative must have been an unfortunate minority or just rude spiteful people. The iPhone XR I received looks like it was new from an Apple store. No scuffs, scratches, marks, or even a fingerprint on it taking it from the shipping box. So now we get to my one and only complaint. The battery was completely depleted and there is nothing more heartbreaking then having to wait a couple minutes for a battery to charge enough to turn on. So all in all, great experience and phone."
406,My Son Got this for His Birthday  and He was Happy and He Already got a Screen Protector and a Case It is Good  I Give a 10/10 I Suggest getting it
407,"Let me start by saying that I not only wanted this to work, I NEEDED this to work. A new phone was out of my budget so I bought this phone and the iPhone SE refurbished by Amazon.They showed up and looked great. The XR had a tiny dot, almost like a pinch, on the screen and battery life 82%. Ok, decent start. Over the first day I realized I couldn't hear from the ear piece, it sounded muffled like under water. The only way to use the phone was speaker. This was not going to work for me. So I sent it back and figured it was just bad luck.The next one came and I felt like I was one of the lucky ones. Battery life was at 90% and it looked perfect. The sound was great. It worked smoothly. I was successful.That was last week when it came. One week later and the screen just shut off at 70% battery while I was reading a message. So it was not dead. But its gone and won't turn back on.I wish I could even explain the hassle this has been. I wish I could say it was a fluke. But this is the second XR from Amazon in a row. The other iPhone SE went back as well. It was so slow and the screen was not responsive. I got locked out on the first day because the touch screen and keypad didn't respond.Please save yourself the headache. Stay far away."
408,At first I thought it would be a scam but it’s a real iPhone and it work like it’s brand new out the box
409,Bought this phone for my teen since they break their phone every year. Great value and easy to use. Looks brand new.
410,La verdad todo muy bien en Ecuador funciona lo único q me vino la pantalla con unas rayitas media superficial pero nada grande
411,"90% of the time this phone was great. But it only lasted a year and 4 months. Which....for how little I use it, was not great in my opinion.  It was wonky at times, doing random things but never anything significant. It powered off the other day, and seems to be fried now.  Couldn't even restore it....Time for a new one, I guess."
412,I’ve added my dad to team iPhone lol. The phone we received had a super tiny scratch on the side of the screen but nothing crazy damaging to the phone! It still works great! Looks and sounds great! And my dad is loving his phone! I’ve ordered another phone previously with this same seller and just recommended my mother to purchase one from here as well. So far so good !
413,"Little nicks off the metal around the camera and sides. And the mics/speaker areas are dirty af. Overall the phone is solid though. Like, the glass isn’t broken or trying to come apart.It’s for my old dad so he doesn’t need brand new quality as long as it turns on and functions fine. I got it to update to iOS 15 yesterday, no glitches or apple icon forever screen. At hundreds of dollars I was hoping for less nicks or scratches but my dad says it’s fine so I gave 4 stars for effort and the fact that it actually turned on 😅 ngl I was worried I may have bought a dud. Guess we will see if it lasts till January…(when the warranty ends)"
414,Nice phone for 10 days. Then just stopped. Returned
415,"I honestly bought this to replace my iPhone 6.Being candid, I’m to the point of disdain with Apple. They used to be geared towards creatives, and still are. Some of the music apps I use on my iPad and iPhone are, alone, enough to keep me. The machines are superior to the competition. But jacking the cost of their mid-level laptops near $1800 (think new, with 16 gb ram and what do they give you a SSD with not enough memory?Anyway, this phone has a pretty large screen so I can  actually utilize apps like Garage Band (everyone knows that program so I’ll use it for example). There is so much going on in that program, as of the last few years I have just enough room to use it fairly well. This phone is quite heavy. It’s at least twice as heavy as my 6sx.3 gb ram( thought about kicking the dough for the models just a notch up in the ‘X’ family, but the price was a lot higher.I like the red color. I didn’t know it, but I guess it’s an AIDS Awareness special model. I was already aware there was a disease called AIDS, but know I have to keep it in a case so I don’t look like a ‘cause’ person.Bottom line. I have not got into the camera features, but the video when run into my 50”4K knockoff brand, looks fantastic."
416,Amazing iPhone XR I love it I bought one for me and one for my daughter I ended up returning mine not because anything was wrong with it only because I wanted the 11 Pro Max which is only a little bit bigger than this iPhone XR my daughter still has hers and it works amazingly haven’t had one problem both phones we received with not one scratch they were brand new looking and they were shipped pretty quickly I believe we received them within three days so I definitely recommend buying from the seller
417,"It’s been a great phone!! There were some bugs that I just chose to live with, one of them being that the keypad would not come back up sometimes when I took the phone off my ear after finishing a phone call and I would have to click the lock button once or twice for it to come back up so I could hang up. I know there was another issue, but it was so small I can’t remember what it was. All in all, it is more than a good deal for the price you’re paying. I was in a tight spot financially I needed a good phone and got waaaay more than I expected. Also, a word to the not so wise about smart phones, GET TEMPERED GLASS SCREEN PROTECTORS!!!! If you don’t think you can afford $12 (on the high end) for a screen protector, then be prepared to spend hundreds to replace your screen when it no longer functions properly lol 😬… they have literally saved me hundreds of dollars."
418,The phone is good as described.
419,After a year battery life goes down significantly.  Phone gets hot if used longer than 10 minutes.
420,"The battery life isn’t as good as it could be but, the battery health was only 88% when I got it. Other then that it’s perfect"
421,Came with no scratches on the screen or glass back. There was the tiniest scratch on the camera lens itself but nothing that affects the quality of it. All i had to do was switch my sim card from my Iphone 8 to the Iphone xr and boom my phone was all good to go. would definitely buy again.
422,"The Amazon Premium Renewed gets 5 stars all on its own. If you can find a device with that, pay the extra (from 'just' Amazon Renewed) and get it! Also, absolutely cannot tell the phone was ever pre-owned or pre-used!!The iPhone XR was an upgrade gift for my Dad from my Mom. His old device was an iPhone 6. He takes ALOT of photos. Every truck show, every tractor show, every time the grands are around, and all the weird bugs... he has pics - lol. And his iPhone 6 (8GB! Lol) ran into a conundrum: It was full of photos, so it didn't have space for his updates. And because it couldn't update, he couldn't upload his photos to the cloud. Also, he wanted a bigger screen. (I'm the same, why put on glasses when you can just have a bigger screen 🤷🏼‍♀️).I honestly thought that the 'swipe the screen away' feature - replacing the home button - would drive him up the wall. He hasn't said a word! (BEEEEELIEVE me... he's at that wonderful, fully liberated age where he says whatever he thinks and does 👊🏻 not 👊🏻 care). He truly loves this phone! Score 1 for technology when an OG Baby Boomer embraces the ease of use, transitioning up (what?) 4 years in advancements and upgrades AND LIKES IT!!"
423,The purchase is new and sweet. Great investment and awesome shipping time.
424,My son loves it
425,I had the iPhone 8 for a while and had to upgrade. Trustworthy purchase. Was delivered 2 days early. No complaints.
426,I must say this was my first time buying a refurbished phone and I was skeptical about it but I read reviews and many said they got nearly mint condition phones. So I bought it and they sent me a phone with plenty of scratches on the screen. I found that unacceptable and I contacted the seller. I returned that phone and they sent me a phone that’s immaculate. I mean it might as well be brand new and the battery is PERFECT. I don’t have to charge this battery more than once a day with moderate use. This is my first iPhone as well and although there are some features I wish they had that were more like Android I can now understand the iPhone fanboys. The seller was so accommodating and I feel like I got a brand new phone for much cheaper than regular price. I wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4 stars and the only reason why I would deduct a half star is because they gave me a bad charger. Because of that I can’t give a 5 star review. Sorry. But I used my Samsung fast charger with the iPhone cord and it charges fast now. Other than that I highly recommend this seller.
427,"Phone was almost perfect. Physically nice. Battery health was 88% which was disappointing, but I didn't mind... Until it plummeted to 84% within the first 24 hours of having it. That's a bad omen if not a sign of % spoofing. Kinda bummed, Verizon."
428,"I had hoped for more of an awesome phone, but I was not impressed. This is my second iPhone. I will list the pros: battery saver mode, volume, and the storage (128gb). I’ve had the phone since October and I am nowhere near using even 1/3 of the storage space. Now my cons: battery life & camera. I bought this phone refurbished (or Renewed) via Amazon. After receiving it and giving it a full charge, battery life was only at 81%. That sucks. 90 or more would have been nice. So as far as a full charge lasting a full day, that’s a no for me. Should’ve returned it when I saw this, but I really needed a phone and was heading out of town. The physical condition of the phone was really good. There was a scratch on the edge of the phone, other than that, my other physical issues. It has been in a case with a screen protector since day 1. I actually bought 3 cases so that it was covered. Overall I’d give this phone a B-. Mainly due to the drained battery it came with and the less than decent camera."
429,"If you’re being skeptical and not sure if it’s worth it, let me go ahead and let you know that’s it’s 100% worth it. This is actually my third purchase from here. The only thing I didn’t like is that I couldn’t get the phone with same day shipping 😂"
430,It’s a good phone just the battery health came at 87% and found a red dot on the screen
431,"The phone is super super nice. the only issue i had was it was slower to update. but got that figured out. also is taking a while to transfer everything from other iphone. Other than those, it’s amazing to use!"
432,It works great no issues at all
433,I’ve purchased every iPhone since the iPhone 6 was released from Amazon 2nd time buying from this seller. Every phone showed up in perfect condition.
434,Was a great phone till it was stolen
435,I bought a renewed iphone XR. No problems with anything at 2 weeks. Works and looks just like a new phone
436,Very happy with the iPhone XR from Amazon. It's like new and all features work. Great price as well. Thank you Amazon.
437,I bought this phone as a work phone. It is used but you really can’t tell. It was like getting a new phone at 1/3 of the price! Very happy!!
438,Okay first of all.. I bought this phone from the cellular resource.. before my phone came I read so many reviews and HARDLY anyone shared who they got the phone from.. now that that’s covered the phone is in mint condition no scratches on my screen or on the back.. a few small scratches on the sides.. nothing to make me send it back (SO FAR).. I’m in love with it.. I upgraded from the 7 plus..
439,Great phone!
440,I have always been a Samsung person. The last phone I purchased gave me so much trouble and I got flustered daily. My son talked me into an Apple to try. I was amazed how fast this phone is and how easy it is to work. I had a stroke 2 years ago and I no longer handle change well. I have had this phone less than a week and I love it already.Highly recommend switching to Apple.
441,"I needed a new phone and i took a look at this , its looked great so i bought it . Best choice ever . i got the color black and you cannot see any scratches, it comes with a screen protector and charger . The phone is real and amazing for the price , i really love it ."
442,13 year old daughter loves this phone.
443,"I went through HELL getting this phone because, I put the wrong address. But the phone is high quality and unlocked! But.. the battery is only 89% I’m still satisfied because I did t find one scratch. Their customer support is trash. But, 4/5"
444,Everything works really good so far no troubles with it and no scratches. This is the second time I have ordered from them.
445,"very good phone, I'm not going to give it 4 stars because the first model I ordered came with a problem and that was already the part replaced."
446,"This iPhone arrived earlier that expected, plus intact and ready to use on WiFi. I took the in for a service plan and had zero issues setting it up. My child and I are super happy with the seller and product. Thank you 😊"
447,"So far so good I ordered it on Monday and got it on Thursday! I am used to a Samsung so the battery life kinda sucks for me lol, and so far nothing is wrong with it, it’s a great working phone. Also it came with a case and screen protector which was nice ! I was very skeptical but I rlly like it"
448,Great phone. Zero issues. No scratches. Works and looks as if brand new! Would buy again.
449,The screen
450,"This is our second XR renewed phone, and I have to say we are pleased with both of them. We purchased the same phone from two different sellers. The first one our son purchased so I do not know the seller. If I had known it, I would’ve used that seller. I know this doesn’t help you. I will try to find that other seller’s name if I can. The only differences were the first phone came with an actual iPhone brand charger, this one did not. It also came with the basic iPhone get started pamphlet. This one did not. It also came with a clear, solid case. This one did not. Those are questions you may want to ask. Since the first phone had those items, I just assumed it was typical, but it’s not. As far as performance, I think they’re equal. The battery MAY be a bit less than a new one, that’s expected. But the savings are well-worth it, IMO. It looks new, functions like new. I’ve been using it for six weeks now and it’s been flawless. If you can’t spend or don’t want to spend the money for brand-new, I think these phones are great."
451,Phone had a lot of issues do not recomend
452,nothing to complain the iphone came in perfect condition and the battery 84%
453,"The phone is good, but the battery is 80%"
454,Was “like new”. Great value
455,"Received my phone today, (renewed and unlocked), came in mint condition, no imperfections or flaws noticed so far, and with a brand new screen protector on which was a nice surprise! Super impressed with how fast it is and how well everything works!"
456,"You get all the aspects of a brand new phone w/o paying full price. This is good for people on budgets and it’s good for the environment. I love the idea of used phones, tablets, etc. 10/10 works like new!"
457,I got this phone for my son. I expected it to come with a charger but it came with none. I'm in the bahamas and had to pay an additional $45 just to buy him a charger to be able to use the phone
458,Me llego con 98 porciento de condicion de bateria y tiene algunas como manchitas de usado pero casi no seve y esta casi nuevo me encanto no tiene fallas de fabrica que alla visto asta ahora por si tienes dudas creeme que con la experiencia de uso te lo recomiendo.
459,I really liked it. No flaws other than a small scratch on the side! Battery is very good. But thank you very much especially for the fast delivery!!!
460,Condición de batería muy baja.
461,I got this phone about 4 months ago and I love it the screen quality is awesome the battery does run out a little fast but not to bad overall I love this phone and you should definitely get!!
462,It was great overall the screen looks replaced but other than that everything works great product
463,This is so good. It works perfectly fine. No scratches or anything it came safe and I would look forward to buying more.
464,The phone over all was in near new condition. There is a very small scratch on the screen that was it and the only reason I didn’t send it back was the glass screen protector I put on it covered the scratch. Besides I really needed the phone and couldn’t wait for a replacement. So far no issues however I only had it a week.
465,The phone is in excellent conditions.
466,No problems!
467,"This phone came looking brand new, with a screen protector and a charger! Love it! So glad I made this purchase!"
468,
469,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 The phone is good for the price. Camera is decent, face recognition works great. My only issue is it can’t fit my SIM card from my iPhone 7plus"
470,"I bought XR in excellent condition but it had a lot of scratches around the camera, it looked really bad. I bought a cover to hide it but I failed."
471,just needs a a restart after setup or somethings may not work like app store. It gave some issues.
472,"Came nicely packed and sealed. Opened it and not a single scratch on the screen or on the body! Had to return two phones because they had a scratch on the screen and it’s worth it to get the premium version. Booted up perfectly, unlocked and battery health was 100%. I bought this as a gift for my dad and am so glad!I bought another phone via backmarket, but their return process involves going to usps which is a timesuck. Prefer to go through Amazon."
473,Phone came in EXCELLENT condition and everything works as it should. Will definitely be buying more phone from here.
474,"For the price, this phone can’t be beat. It’s virtually a brand new phone at a fraction of the price. Don’t miss your opportunity to save money and enhance your tech experience."
475,The phone is in great shape and it practically look brand new the only thing i dont like is that the call volume is a little low
476,Love my new phone. Works perfectly. Even survived going swimming with me for 15 minutes. Looks and works flawlessly.
477,"I spent almost a month with this phone and their hasn't been any problems with data, battery, calls, quality, or anything else. I switched from an iphone 6s, which doesn't turn on anymore, and it is amazing not having to charge 2-3 times a day. This battery is fine throughout the whole day with mild to intense use. With mild use and school going on, the battery can last me almost 2 days. I've seen reviews where the battery comes at 100% but mine was not included in those cases. My phone came at 92% and that annoys me a little but it's worth the 100 dollars I save by not buying it from the apple store. I am not sure about waterproofing but my phone came without a scratch or a chip on the aluminum paint. It was like it was new besides for the fact of the battery. I was really happy with it but another annoying thing was that they didn't require a signature with the delivery, my neighbors have stolen airpods that I've ordered before so I was quite annoyed by the fact that they just left it in the mail box without making me personally accept it or sign for it. Beware about that if you live in a shady neighborhood or busy street."
478,"Overall a solid choice for a cheaper phone. I’ve had it for about 7 months and everything still works as it should. The only exception is that the top speaker for phone calls was busted when it came, but I rarely use it so it made little difference to me. The battery came at 89% and is now at 87%. Still lasts all day and then some."
479,"I was extremely disappointed in the screen & case of the phone.  Dents on every corner. Glass screen edges chipped, numerous scratches deep & superficial.  The instructions stated nothing visible if holding this 12 inches away.  Clearly this was passed & should not have been for the condition of the overall exterior.  On a positive note the phone operated perfectly.  Battery life great!  Everything functioned well.  I returned due to the physical condition."
480,"I bought 3 of these and had to return one due to the FaceID not working, but the other 2 are great - definitely worth the price, and the XR is still fast and upgradeable even though an older model. I did have to return one of them because the FaceID didn’t work. I took it to the Apple store for diagnostics and they said it was because the true depth camera function didn’t work. I had no issues with returning it and the refund was issued promptly."
481,There was no scratches or cracks apart from around the camera but it's tiny and barely noticeable. Phone works great and face id is fast and accurate! would buy again. EDIT: it’s been about 2 weeks ish the phone works great still (some lag when typing fast) but that’s about it and i recently found out that the phone actually came unlocked and came with a pre-installed screen protector would definitely recommend this seller
482,device came as described but the rear glass came full of signs of use and the screen with some scratches
483,"It was delivered earlier than expected. It looks like new, no dings, dents or scratches. It came with a screen protector already on it plus a cord and wall charger. No issues to date. It’s working perfectly. The price was better than all the major stores for a used version of this phone."
484,"Phone functions properly, no scratches or issues. Battery is in good shape. Good value for money."
485,el teléfono está impecable
486,"The only thing wrong is the face id is pretty janky and it glitches sometimes, but other than that a very solid choice if you want a cheap phone."
487,"I purchased this iPhone XR 128gb Premium Renewed on a Thursday and received it the following Monday. Upon inspection, it looked perfect! The screen has zero scratches, no scuffs at all on the base, no guck in the speaker ports..It could have passed for brand new! Transferring from my older iPhone went flawlessly. The battery health is at 90%. I was hoping for 100%, but Amazon promised at least 90, so I’m not complaining, especially considering the condition this phone is in. I’ve been using it for a week now and have had zero problems. I’m glad I made this purchase."
488,"It came in a nice box with all the things you need. The phone was like new and when I say that, I mean it has not one nick or scratch if you told me it was brand new I wouldn’t have known any difference. Definitely worth the money."
489,"I recently got this phone and I must say. For $250, it’s fine. Not worth much more tho. It has a tiny lcd screen problem, but only on a white screen. Biggest problem is that battery health is at 82%. Other than that it’s fine."
490,"The phone is in perfect condition! The only thing that worried me was my package coming in late, but other than that it’s good!!"
491,"I was leery to buy this phone, but it’s perfect. After I broke two brand new iPhones, I decided to buy a used one online. It works exactly as it should, with zero problems. I’ll definitely use this seller again if I need another older phone in the future."
492,"Vino con algunas trizaduras, pero el teléfono en general en muy buen estado."
493,Happy with the speed in which I received this phone.  The quality for the price is superb.
494,"The phone is great. Battery life, streaming, face ID, everything is top quality. The only thing I will say is that the screen gets scratched pretty easily, so make sure you get a screen protector and case on it pretty quickly."
495,Love the color easy to find phone ! Works great!!
496,Love the face recognition and screen wuslity
497,The Merchant was no help when my package was delayed they provided me no help or concern but the phone is a great phone very much recommend
498,"The iPhone XR was in good shape and was also just like brand new , the screen was nice , the body of the phone and battery life was good!"
499,Phone arrived quickly. Excellent condition for a refurbished phone. Battery usually lasts me all day.
500,My battery life was at 87% for bad for a 4 year old phone comes with a tempered glass screen protector on the phone a charger (not and oem apple charger) and it comes with a block the new iPhones don’t even do that but the product it good worth the prices no scratches on mine and works fine
501,I had the phone less than a month and it’s already glitchy and the screen turned green a few times
502,                    The media could not be loaded.                 this phone is great alot if people review it’s as bad but so far it’s great for me everything no problems at all not even scratches it’s hard for me to believe it’s not brand new i would recommend buying if you want to take the risk because i think it all depends on which one you get it’s a 50/50 shot in if it’s a good one you get it a problematic im going to definitely order another one for my daughter hope this helps!
503,Loved the phone size is better
504,"I bought this phone in December 2020 because my iPhone 7 plus was not compatible with Verizon, which I was switching to from Cricket. I have to say, I was somewhat leery due to multiple reviews that were not happy with this phone, and during the holiday season, over $400 was quite a lot to shell out on a 'maybe' this is a good phone. But, I bought my 7 plus refurbished in April 2020, and it was still working great (still is, as I use it for gaming and reading ebooks), so I decided to go out on a limb. I'm quite happy that I did. The phone only had one noticeable scratch on it, which was easily covered by a phone case, and it works flawlessly. The battery life was at 88% then and now (I was slightly disappointed to be dropping from 96%), and it will last me all day long. I work 11+ hours in a poor signal area, and by the time I get home, I still have over 45% battery life remaining. By far better than any Samsung products I've used in the past."
505,"I was very hesitant to buy a used phone. It's hard to know exactly what you are going to get. Of course, you want to believe it is going to be perfect but you do have to be realistic, because it's used. I'm happy to report the phone was nearly perfect. It has no scratches at all, no marks or anything negative about the appearance. I took it to get a sim card and everything transferred perfectly from my old phone. I didn't miss a beat. I know some people are particular about this one but I did get an Apple brand charging cable too. The battery was full and it lasts a long time! I go all day with using various apps and phone calls and even use it with the controller while flying my drone. At bedtime, around 1:00am, I still have about 50% battery left from the charge the night before. The only thing weird is the iPhone podcast app does not work. It says ""There is a problem and the Podcast Library needs to be rebuilt before continuing."" When I click Rebuild Library, it never finishes doing anything. I have even kept touching the screen to keep the phone from going to sleep in hopes that the rebuild would be successful. I eventually deleted the app and re-downloaded it from the App Store. Everything seemed to be fine and then... I got the same message. I will eventually take it to the Apple Store to see what they can do but for now, the rest is perfect and I am glad I saved a few hundred bucks."
506,Easy set up. Added to phone carrier and transferred my stuff from the cloud. No issues so far
507,"This is hands down the best phone I’ve owned. Package came in no problem. Phone was in mint condition, everything works fast and normal. Only two downsides came with my phone: Battery Health being at 88% and top speaker (next to camera) sounds a little busted. Although there are issues I had, don’t let that stop you from buying this phone, it’s perfect!"
508,The phone came kind of scratch up on the speaker of the phone but other then that it good
509,This was my first time purchasing a refurbished phone and was unsure of the condition it would arrive in and how well it would work.  It was for my teenage daughter and it works great.  No visible blemishes and no issues whatsoever.  Battery is at 87% of original life.  Great phone for the price.  I just ordered a second phone for my other daughter and hope it works just as well.
510,"Got for granddaughter, she loves the color. Just like brand new. Had it totally set up ready to use within couple hours. Great camera features !"
511,"Looks and feels new, really happy with the phone!"
512,"So I was kinda worried buying a Renewed phone cuz I saw some bad reviews but I took a gamble cuz my IPhone 7 ended up breaking and I wanted to upgrade but didn’t have that much money to buy new, It came in today and so far I have no complaints everything works really well. I’ll update if anything happens with the phone but I am Very happy with this purchase"
513,"I purchased two of these phones for my boyfriend and I. We had been avid android users since owning our first cellphone. I cannot bring myself to purchase an iPhone full price. I did know an iPhone XR would be great for me. I convinced my boyfriend to get an XR also. I looked and looked every but Amazon for a phone. I didn’t like any of them in my price range. I decided to look and see what Amazon had. I found this seller. I read reviews and decided to try this seller because most reviews were positive. This phone is better than I anticipated. It looked almost flawless except for a Trent tiny nick at the very top of the screen. VERY PLEASED. Battery lasts a long time. Phone is fast and functions like how I would expect a new one to work. I used it for a solid month before writing a review so I could see any defects. My boyfriends was flawless no nicks or anything. His functions exceptionally like it should. Price was very fair with the market. I would definitely recommend these. Also they came with a silicon type case and a glass screen protector to put on it. AGAIN, VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE."
514,"For starters: it depends on what seller you go through when ordering these phones. I bought mine through Digital Age USA and the phone is perfect! It said it was supposed to arrive February 2nd but it arrived January 19th. I’m sure it’s because I live only a few hours away from where it was shipping from. It did come with a charger box that wasn’t Apple but if you actually read the description it says that could happen and that it won’t come with headphones. Completely understandable considering these are used phones. Other than a TINY scratch on the outside of the back camera, the phone is flawless with no severe scratches. I’ve had the phone for 2 days now and I haven’t run into any issues. The touch screen works perfectly and I was able to turn it on through Total Wireless (which goes through Verizon).My advice for anyone wanting to get a renewed phone: LOOK AT THE SELLER! The seller I bought this from has a 90% rating. The very next day a different seller was on here with only a 70% rating. If the seller doesn’t have a good rating DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!! Wait until another seller comes up with decent reviews."
515,The phone was unlocked and very easy to transfer all of the content over from the old phone. The phone is in remarkable condition and was purchased at a fair price as compared to other sites.
516,"Everything is so good face recognition,it has great battery life, and the screen quality is so great I just love the phones period"
517,I wouldn’t recommend buying phones off of Amazon I only did it because I lost my phone and didn’t have time to wait for days or didn’t want to go to the store and spend the extra money and this came the day after I have prime and the phone works amazing I have Boost Mobile and at work just as good as my other iPhone there’s no problems with it at all and it even came like brand new I definitely recommend getting that from the seller at least and definitely buy it unlocked because if you read the other comments there’s people were complaining but they bought it  with AT&T or Sprint
518,"Device arrived in very good shape and WAS unlocked as promised.  I only activated it long enough to get the IMEI from it to process the trade-in, so I didn't ever USE it as a working device.  But I will say that I was pleasantly surprised to actually get what the seller promised (since so many try to rip you off)."
519,The phone came in very good condition and was unlocked. Everything is working fine so far. If there is anything wrong I'll report back.
520,The phone was received in good condition only slight scratches around camera.
521,"so far so good, works great. just the battery run a little bit fast. but its ok"
522,"I found out after inquiring that the XR version has trouble capturing bluetooth speakers or other bluetooth accessories. One solution called for downloading some Apple updates. After this, I got it to hook up with one wireless speaker. Otherwise, the phone performs great with excellent features and screen."
523,"I have stopped buying phones from cell phone providers as I can’t agree with paying that much money. In the past I've done FB marketplace or offer up for new/gently used iPhones. But I have limited time for the leg work of driving around searching. So I decided to give Amazon a shot. I was skeptical to buy a refurbished phone so I searched for the stores with the best reviews. I had wanted a white phone but the stores carrying it had a few bad reviews. So settled for the “Coral Pink)  It arrived on time through Fed EX. It came with a screen cover already placed which was nice. No apple chargers but generic brand charger. I did call about 3x to ask some questions and left messages. I never received a call back but when I messaged through Amazon, they responded.I think the battery life is good but I haven’t been paying attention.I really like the face recognition, although at times it doesn’t read my face and have to put passcode. Not a big deal."
524,Honestly I was very sceptical because of the reviews and the low price. But it turned out awesome. Looks like new and only took a couple days to be delivered.
525,I’ve had this phone for almost 3 weeks and the screen started chipping and just now hardly dropped it in a otter box case now there’s bubbles behind the screen
526,"El celular llego en muy buen estado, la pantalla no tenia ni una sola raya y la parte de atrás tampoco. La vida de la batería podría haber sido mejor pero cumple con lo que prometen."
527,"Solid, Just as Expected"
528,"I upgraded from a 64 gig 6s and let me tell you I was having so much problems with it. And then I bought this iPhone. I love it so much! The color, the size, the battery life, Face ID all of it 100% recommend buying!"
529,"Exceeded my expectations!I’ve had this phone for a little over 5 months now and it’s been smooth sailing the entire time. The phone works flawlessly and the camera quality is gorgeous. I was a little sad about the battery life, however it still easily lasts 2-3 days without needing a charge. There were a few scratches on the top right of the scree, but with a screen protector you could not tell at all. Overall amazing for the price!"
530,Arrived in great condition and I love the features
531,It likes to die at 15-25% also when charging past 20% it will give me the low battery notification
532,"I was a bit skeptical but tried anyway. Phone is fully unlocked and was in perfect condition. Absolutely no damage to the phone at all. If not for the description I would have thought it was brand new. All I done was put my SIM card in, install an update and it was good to go for AT&T. Would recommend in the future. 5 out of 5 for me."
533,I love how it’s supper affordable an is still functioning amazing
534,My 11 year old son gift. Everything works great.
535,Arrived quickly and was like new with charging cords and plugs
536,The phone has no scratches or beautiful flaws and works perfectly
537,"Just like new! So far Im really impressed! I bought this XR after my old XR got run over by a car accidentally. This one arrived really fast, was packaged well and didnt have a scratch on it. Battery health says 98%! Restored it to my iCloud backup in less than an hour and BOOM! Its like my old phone was never damaged! At literally HALF THE COST of a “refurbished” XR from Apple, Id def recommend this seller! Ill report back if there are any issues, but so far Im impressed!"
538,"1. I got the phone in the male several days EARLY which made me so very happy.2. I opened the box and just like any other refurbished company you can’t expect a premium box and headphones so I wasn’t shocked that there was only a charger.3. The charger works well and it’s lasted almost a month now.4. Now for the phone review, I love it so much. It came with 88% battery life which isn’t the best but it’s okay because it is definitely an upgrade from an iPhone 7 or 8, the battery lasts probably around 4 - 5 hours with heavy usage such as watching shows, videos, etc. The screen came with a glass screen protector on it.5. I was a little upset to see that the camera has dings on it. Like it was banged up by the precious owner. For a refurbished phone I was honestly just happy I could upgrade whether the phone had a little ding on the camera. The camera was in perfect working condition.The screen was not cracked.If you’re looking for a cheaper upgrade this is a good option and I think it’s worth the $$.I’m writing the review on the phone... lol"
539,"I thought this phone would serve my needs, sadly, it cant maintain a charge, and the longer I have it the more issues I have . So of course the problems started happening after the return period for a refund.  I now have a one way service on the phone, no one can reach me.  And I purchased Asurion to cover it and they wa t me to se d it back and they'll replace it with another refurbished unit, maybe  reimburse the cost, which leaves with a net return of $150. Dont buy one unless you are prepared for hassles."
540,This phone looks and operates like new.
541,"This was a birthday gift , the iPhone arrived in perfect condition ( just like new) !!! Btw this my first iPhone, my daughters set up for me without any issues! My friend saved hundreds of dollars purchase this phone & I couldn’t be happier, the battery life & face recognition is amazing!!! I save so much time & energy with my new iPhone what a blessing!! I’m a happy camper.. Amazon is to go store online & 50% or more of my purchase come from Amazon!! This will be my store for eternity.😇😍"
542,"el telefono me vino sin golpes, abolladuras o rayones 10/10 su estado, interno la bateria estaba en 90% asi que me quedan poco para cambiarla en el futuro.de hay sin errores de recalentamiendo por uso dentro de la oficina o casa, obvio si hay sol si se calienta pero no tanto, como si fuera construido en aluminio. 8/10 es estado interno.la caja biene solo con una tarjeta, el iphone, un cargador y cable no oficial de apple. yo recomiendo no usar el adaprtador de corriente puede que danie la salud de la bateria a futuro como tengo de mis dispositivos antiguos uso de esos el cable si lo utilizo y bueno."
543,I bought my phone and it had some scratches. If you don’t like scratches on ur phone you shouldn’t buy this.
544,Uso personal
545,"Came with tiny scratches, but it works and looks great."
546,Amazon Renewed is the best way to go.
547,"Upgraded from a 6S to an XR and was glad to upgrade processor speed, screen size, camera, and battery life. My 6S was at 64% battery maximum capacity so I've learned a few things on what that means and had really low expectations for battery health. Below 80% requires much more charging. I payed for a premium renewed and was disappointed that it came at 93% maximum capacity THEN IT DROPPED TO 88% after a few days of use and installs. What? With almost no scratches or dings on the body but come on...something doesn't seem right. If this helps with accountability, the phone tester was MM. I will probably keep and pay the $69 at Apple to replace the battery if it comes to it. If Amazon Renewed could help explain the sudden 5% drop in battery maximum capacity over a few days that would also be so great, fingers crossed."
548,It’s exactly what they described. Recommended
549,"This purchase has been extremely gratifying from start to finish!  Thank you so much!  I am a very satisfied customer!  I see one very, very minor indication that my product is not completely brand new, but I am hoping that its continued outstanding performance completly overshadows this, as it has so far!"
550,Great phone ty have a blessed evening
551,A couple small nicks around the camera. Other than that perfect working condition so far.
552,I am so happy with my purchase. I usually don't write reviews but I am so pleased I needed to. I got the renewed premium and it is definitely worth the money because it is as if I have a 100% brand new phone for half the price. no scratches or dents the phone looks flawless. I would purchase again. hope this helps if your on the cusp!
553,No problems with the phone and it came with a screen protector.The only part I was unsure of is the phone heats up when using a lot of dataBut it’s battery life is so long. This phone is a A-
554,The product came in excellent condition! very perfect! I recommend!
555,There was a little bit of ugly cosmetic damage on the edges but once a case was on it wasn’t noticeable. This was bought for my nephew in Egypt 🇪🇬. And yes I did bring it to him and yes it is working just fine and he was able to connect service without any issues thankfully. So all in all it was worth the purchase minus the fact that no ear buds were included. My nephew is very happy with his iPhone. He has wanted one for many years and they are too expensive in Egypt.
556,"I love the phone. I’ve been saving you for it for two months, and finally got it I was so anxious for it to arrive. It was in perfect condition no cracks,chips, or anything like that battery life almost to full capacity, I am very satisfied with the product."
557,Still learning the new system phone in excellent condition no scratches.
558,"Phone looks brand new! I placed and order, got scared so I cancelled. Placed it the next day and I am so glad I did! Thank you for not ripping me off. My husband is happy 😀"
559,"Producto en muy buenas condiciones, sin ningún problema hasta ahora"
560,Look like new ! But the battery life is at 86%
561,it arrived in good condition
562,Phone is just perfect no scratches or cracks and its unlocked i love it
563,"Only minor scratches. Battery life is good, works great so far. Had for about 6 months."
564,"Id purchase again .It’s a good deal , you won’t be disappointed."
565,"My niece had been wanting an iPhone and going direct from apple was going to cost me over 800 this was under 350 and it was everything she wanted and needed. Phone came in excellent condition, camera works great! Zero complaints from my niece who is a teen. If looking for a iPhone but don’t want to go brand new, I would definitely consider this company again!"
566,"The function qualities are good.The only problem that my soon has had is that the phone, for no apparent reason, will ""glitch"", the screen will basically freeze up, so you can't use the phone at all unless it is powered off completely, then turned back on. This makes him very frustrated as you can imagine. It has done this twice so far. He has only had it a few short weeks, and has not dropped it, I made sure that it had a very sturdy case before letting him have it. There are only social media apps and a very few games from the Apple store on it. He likes his phone, but having O.D.D., ADHD, and autism spectrum, those kind of things, like what's happening with his phone, can be more frustrating."
567,The only con for me was the battery life expectancy of the battery was at 89% but other than that the phone came pretty quick and the quality of the phone even though it was refurbished was awesome. Would purchase a whole lot more from this seller in the future.
568,I really can’t complain about this choice of purchase. It’s still working like brand new and battery life is not slowing down. I’m on FaceTime a lot and use my phone all the time for work and entertainment. I’m very satisfied and I’m glad I chose a refurbished phone since that’s what was in my budget. I highly recommend this seller. It definitely has quality work done!
569,Battery is good compared to iPhone 8The iPhone 6s was iPhones best model IMOThis phone is a little glitchy sometimes but we’ll see 6 months from now
570,"Still more like the older IPhones.  Wanted a better camera, but most features on thus camera seem similar to my 6S."
571,Good quality and price.
572,"I absolutely love this phone! I was very skeptical and scared to purchase due to the many bad reviews. I decided to give it a try anyway, because I really needed a new phone. BEST CHOICE BY FAR! Literally looks exactly like the picture, the screen is amazing , and the picture quality is even better! The setup was literally under 15 minutes, and it took only 2 seconds to switch my SIM card to this phone and my service was automatically connected. Also for those who want to know, this is compatible with cricket. I am a cricket customer and you literally only have to change the SIM card over, now I was coming from a iPhone 6 so I had to flip my sim upside down to fit in properly. If you don’t feel uncomfortable doing it yourself you can totally go in a store and have them do it and it’s FREE! Wish I had pictures but I’m currently using it! :). Also it doesn’t come with headphones but I did purchase AirPods, plus I had my own set of headphones, it does come with a charger. The charger isn’t from Apple so I decided not to use that charger, but everything else is great. It comes very secured in a brown box packaged very well, and the shipping was super fast. I ordered my phone on a Thursday it came on Saturday.  Definitely would recommend!"
573,"I needed this for work and new prices are ridiculous so I came to good ole' Amazon. This came in a generic box...(expected) . Opened and WOW!!, what a beauty not one scratch, Mint Condition!!. Battery max at 84% but holds a long solid charge. We will see how it goes. I was very cautious about spending but for the price I took the chance and what I received, I have definitely come UP!  I recommend taking your time I went through 2 weeks of searching and reviews before choosing this iPhone but well WORTH IT!"
574,Bought it for our son and it looks and functions like a new phone and if I didnt know it was remanufactured I would have thought it was new.
575,I recommend it
576,"Bought this and was a bit skeptical as I've had worse experience with past renewed/refurbished devices.I would have believed that the phone was brand new except that when I took a good look at the phone, I noticed a few small dents to the right of the lightning port.  However, this is no big deal as I slapped a case on and it was unnoticeable.  Other than this, the only complaint I have is that the internal battery appears to have not been replaced ever, settings app claims 88% peak performance.  I'm not going to beat up the seller for this as I do not personally mind, but I would've liked to see a brand new battery.  That's about it, screen seems to be genuine, Face ID works flawlessly, I couldn't be happier with this."
577,Was a little skeptical because of all of the harsh reviews but this was definitely worth it. Not a single scratch on the phone and the camera works great. This is well worth your money!
578,"When searching for a phone, one always has to pay attention to reviews , rating , etc. So I did , and the reviews were over the roof ,"" great phone"", "" brand new look"" ,  yet my luck was different. The phone has the most noticeable scratches in the front as well as the back.  Along the edge there is so many dents that even the paint is gone. The system works perfect , it's just the outer portion of the phone that really disappointed me. I cannot say I like it nor hate it , it's just bothers me that I got a ""fully functional"" phone with a poor outer aesthetic."
579,"It came with very minor screen scratches but overall works like a brand new phone and I was able to activate with Metro PCS but you have to purchase a new SIM card. It did not work with my previous SIM card. Overall, extremely satisfied. Came with a charger too."
580,"It works just like a new one, even came with a screen protector but it was broken when it got here, I had already bought one and it got here fas so that wasn't a problem. The battery life was at 95% which is pretty good since I didn't get the renewed premium. There are no scratches on the screen or the rest of the phone at all so it feels like I got a brand new one, works just fine and I've already downloaded some apps that work perfectly. Overall 10/10"
581,The phone arrived on time and is in great condition!! Great product great price!! Thank you!
582,Bartley life was less than 70% and phone was dirty and had noticeable starches on the glass and bezel.  Did this phone not go though quality control??
583,I love my phone ❤️❤️
584,"fast shipping, item as described. refurbished, couple side scratches on case, no big deal, its refurbished. mine even had a glass screen cover."
585,"came with 100% battery life, no scratches or sign of wear, it’s a big upgrade from the 6+ i had, thank you"
586,"I love this phone!!! Only issue for me was the battery life is at 88%, other than absolute great phone!!!! And it came in a day early! Just buy the daggum phone, it’s worth it, I promise!! Also, no scratches at all, looks brand new!"
587,This phone i bought to use it with my Nexar dash camera. It works great.
588,The phone works well and had a small dent but still in good condition.
589,Mi hijas está feliz.
590,"I was nervous to order a refurbished phone, but was very please! It came in a nice box, everything was packaged nicely! It came with everything the description said was included. My phone plan is with ATT and I was able to use my previous SIM card to activate this one with no issues. The phone arrived quicker than expected, and was in perfect condition! I’m very happy with this purchase."
591,Great
592,"I love my iPhone XR! It’s my first new iPhone since the 7 Plus. It has great face recognition, battery life & screen quality! It even came with a brand new screen protector already on the phone. It got here almost 2 days early, it’s the best early birthday gift from my brother and boyfriend!"
593,"I recently purchased an iPhone XR (renewed) and all the phone’s features such as facial recognition, battery life and screen quality are in excellent condition…almost brand new.  Fast shipping too…I received it a few days earlier than anticipated. The only gripe I have is the way it was shipped.  It was shipped in a Manila envelope with one thin layer of bubble wrap.  Thank goodness nothing happened to my purchase in transit…it was a gift for my partner. I had purchased another phone for myself on Amazon from another vendor and I received it in a sturdy little box wrapped in bubble wrap.  Other than that, I would have given Woot five stars."
594,"I got a refurbished iphone XR and it looks in great condition, however after using it for about 3 weeks, the battery life is no better than my old iphone 6s.  I expected better battery life.  Also the side button to turn the phone on is hard to press down enough to get the phone to turn on.  It also takes a few seconds for it to respond while holding the button down.  This is difficult since i have arthritis in my hands.  I would have expected it to turn on quickly and easily.  The functionality of the phone is great and I like the size of the screen."
595,"Very pleased with this purchase. Shipping package was good quality and phone was wrapped in plastic. When unpacked, phone was in near perfect condition and could not tell if it was ever used. Although original charger was not included, charger included was brand new and of high quality."
596,Good
597,I bought it for a friend and he liked it!
598,"This phone is AWESOME and in 9.9999/10 condition! Buying an Amazon Renewed product comes with a little bit of a lowered expectation for appearance and battery life. However, and that's a big however, this phone was pristine! My order was fulfilled by TRADEMORE. The screen is in perfect shape and is responsive as it should be. Faced works great. The cameras have no wear and work perfectly. The body has one tiny visible scratch that is completely covered by the case. Battery life is 100%! I spent weeks looking for a refurb phone in excellent condition that wasn't overpriced and I'm so glad I went for this one. It also came with Apple branded cable and block which was a huge surprise. Note that every phone is going to be different when you're buying Renewed, but this was a total win. Before this I had ordered a Renewed iPhone XS (it came from a different fulfiller - Kiss Electronics Inc) and it came with a chipped camera, visible scratches, and the sticky cover on the phone was covered in hairs and fibers. It was a huge disappointment and I had to pay return shipping on it. I'm so glad I went for the XR and it far exceeded all of my expectations. I highly recommend!"
599,Bought it for my daughter. She’s a college student and her phone is on use 24/7! She loves it.
600,I was worried the phone would be beat up or just warn out since it is so much cheaper than a new one. But my new phone is great! It has some very minor scratches but other than that it looks and works like a brand new phone for less than half the price! Especially since I have Mint mobile this phone being both way cheaper and unlocked is awesome! I'm buying phones from here from now on!
601,"I love that the Home button is gone, I was always wearing it out. Love how long the battery lasts. I don't do games, as a rule, but I do text and FB a lot, so it is nice to know I can have a connection when I'm spending a lot of time AT the VA ER waiting for my husband to be seen. I do use Kindle on there also. The flashlight and camera icons are always on the screen, again, a big help when fumbling to find the keyhole or where something has dropped.Overall, just so happy with the iPhone XR."
602,There was a chip on the corner buy other then that works good.
603,I was really scared it would be a crappy used phone but all it had was a small scratch on it. Otherwise it’s a beautiful high quality big phone. I switched from android to iPhone and it seems to be one of the best decisions. Love the perks!
604,I waited a couple months to rate this Amazon renewed Iphone. I was quite willing to accept scratches and dings since that is normal wear and tear. This iphone is flawless in appearance and excellent to use. I saw the graphics that some said was a downside but it is not for two reasons: 1- I can't really tell any difference and I can only imagine a very few would even notice it unless professional camera people who woudn't use an iphone for that; 2- Less graphics results in superb battery life. I can use my iphone all day long reading articles and viewing videos and I still have battery at the end of the day. This is true even though this 2 year old iphone has 91% battery capacity compared to brand new. I saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing renewed by Amazon. I will buy buy and recommend renewed iphones from Amazon to anyone.
605,"I have been using Apple products for as long as apples been a thing. I saw this product on multiple commercials and after doing my own research on it I decided to buy it. Some of the best features of this product are its long battery life, user-friendly interface, and low price. The iPhone Xr has the longest battery life out of all the iPhones in its generation and it lasts me the whole day without any problems. Its user interface is also very easy to navigate which makes things very convenient. The best part about this phone is its price starting at $600, compared to other iPhones that cost $1000 and above. There are some negatives to this phone, however. The camera, screen resolution and it is not durable without a case. The camera on this phone is subpar compared to other iPhones in this generation which is to be expected at its given price point. The screen is also subpar to the other iPhones as it can only go up to 1080p resolution compared to 4k. The glass on the back of the phone leaves much to be desired as it can easily shatter without protection from a case. Overall, this phone does have its drawbacks, but it is still a great buy."
606,Battery Is the only downfall even though it’s at 90% dies in about 5 hours other than that it’s like new
607,"It was in good condition. Ear peace speaker grill was ripped, but everything else is very nice and clean."
608,Bp 88%. Was expecting 90 but it is wat it is! Everything else was perfect like new. Oh and i got a screen protector and a case. Good looks!
609,"Fast shipping, but the screen came scratched, many signs of use and scratches on the sides, with 85% battery health."
610,Good working phone but battery life is short
611,Got this iPhone XR for my wife there was a few dings on the outside of the phone that was it runs great for what she needs it for. Love how clear the pictures are when you take one
612,Better than paying new phone purchase price
613,"I bought this to replace an iPhone 6 Plus that I broke and didn't want to fix. It's supposed to be a used phone, but it's indistinguishable from the new XR that AT&T showed me for nearly twice as much ($265 for this, $499 new). Yes, a lot has changed, but the battery lasts longer, the screen has better contrast and clarity, and it's ridiculously fast (even with 11 apps open simultaneously). I think I'm going to enjoy learning to use it..."
614,It came in perfect condition.
615,"I was skeptical to buy used, but it was exactly as described and the battery was 99%.  My wife does not need all the gadgets and apps, they just confuse her, but when you compare to other phones this is a  good option and she did not need the newest phone.  Those that do need the newest and trade in their old in like new condition are perfect for what she needed.  I had previously purchased a new Motorola  6 and what a  waste if electronics and money that was.  Always needed to be restarted and never knew when it needed a reboot, so no one could call or text until she realized no activity for a few days.  This was a good upgrade at apparently a good price.  Forget about the days when phones were free or < $300.  Not happening"
616,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 On the top it has a dirt on it but I cleaned it off . The phone is good but it a little dirty on the outside. Came with SIM card ejecting tool , charger, screen protector. A lot of scratches on the back but nothing to big and I don’t mind it . Overall the phone it’s self is good and has no problems. Battery life was at a 80% btw"
617,This phone is amazing! came just as described i was so so happy. Thank you!
618,"This is my first upgraded iPhone to have the face recognition(just upgraded from an 8plus) & I love it! The Face ID is awesome & so easy to use. The phone came in basically brand new condition, except for the one little scratch I showed in my pictures. Battery life came at 84%, which isn’t the best but expected. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. I ordered my husband the same one but in red because it was so nice for it to be refurbished!"
619,It was delivered on time and came in good condition. Plus they even included a phone case and screen protector  ! Very satisfied and would definitely purchase again.
620,"I’ve had this phone for about a little over a week now and I’m so happy I finally decided to buy this. In all honesty I would have thought this phone was brand new! I had an old iPhone 8+ for the last few years and was in serious need of an upgrade and man I’m so glad I did. The battery life lasts so long and the phone had no superficial markings of any sort, again practically like new. I’ve had no issues with it in any way fortunately, and I was very appreciative of the seller sending me coral when I contacted them since I noticed coral and blue were the same price the day after I ordered, but had ordered blue when coral was previously out of stock. I encourage anyone who has been wanting/needing a new phone but is skeptical, you won’t regret it!"
621,"I can’t even tell that this is renewed. We bought it for my fiancé because his phone was falling apart. The face recognition works perfectly, the battery life was at 90%, and no issues with the screen quality. He has had it for almost a month and no issue. I will update if need be but if not we are looking at purchasing another one from this seller for me."
622,
623,Really satisfied with the purchase. The phone had 2 minor flaws on it but I know that's expected with a renewed phone. Only complaint is the price dropped by $50 after my purchase
624,The phone looked new. Packed very well and shipped Fedex 2 day. Battery was 85%. It was a very good buy!
625,I purchased this phone for my mother who’s switching over from an android phone and she loves it! She hasn’t had any issues with the phone that she’s mentioned to me.
626,"Sound was terrible. Took it to Apple, they spent 3 minutes cleaning and it was good as new."
627,"So my wife was in the market for a new iPhone, upgrading from her iPhone 6, which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work. I couldn't bring myself to pay Apple 800 dollars or more for a new basic phone. I tried to get my wife to agree to an Android and that wasn't going to happen. Then I found these Amazon Renewed phones. I wound up saving about 175 dollars on an almost new iPhone Xr.The phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible, less the original packaging and equipment. The box was a repackage box, the power adapter was an unknown USB wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a week.The migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour, with an iOS upgrade in for good measure (this phone came with 12.2 and 12.4 has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to current).Overall, happy about the phone. Time will tell if I run into issues with it lasting but so far all is good."
628,"Cosmetically, the phone came in good condition, however, the call volume is nearly non existent no matter how much you increase it and it has to be on speaker to take calls.😔 I was really hoping to get as lucky as some of the people on the reviews but I will have to try again."
629,the really good phone
630,"Comprei o iPhone XR 64GB pelo vendedor eKings, o envio foi tão rápido que me surpreendeu, chegando ao destino eu pedi para fazerem uma análise criteriosa do produto, e estava em perfeitas condições, apenas umas marquinhas muito pequenas de capa de celular. Aparelho muito novo, com tudo funcionando perfeitamente e a bateria veio com 90% de saúde! Gostei muito."
631,"El celular vino igual que la foto, sin rasguño en excelente condición, la batería tiene un 86 % vino con buena envotura, tenía un poco de miedo al pedirlo, pero después de comprarlo lo recomiendo defendiendo de cual sea el vendedor, pero para mi fue muy recomendable"
632,"I purchased this phone for my son, he is enjoying it.. The phone works great with no problems."
633,"i was skeptical of buying a phone online but this was the best purchase i've ever made! i'm not kidding, it came in on time, there was no scratches/dents. i thought i would have to buy a phone case but it came with one! it also came with a charger, an extra cable, extra charging block, screen protector, screen cleaner & a small micro fiber rag. i would recommend this item since it came with so many extras!there is only one downside to this phone, in order to make calls, i have to use the speakerphone button in order to be heard on the other end. now i'm not saying i have to use it all the time, but its a majority of the time. my friend told me that it sounds like i'm underwater. the phone calls is where the only issue is at, facetime/messanger/snapchat/instagram all work perfectly fine. meaning i don't have to put the speaker on to be heard."
634,I was looking for a refurbished unlockediPhone and this does the job
635,excellent. love it
636,"I’ve had this phone for one and a half years  and it’s still fully functional, everything works like it’s supposed to."
637,"battery life isn’t that good but that’s expected for a refurbished iphone, other than that it’s good"
638,Got the Black 64 GB XR and it’s been working just perfect for me. No issues. Wish I had the 128 GB but whatever .. I chose this and I must accept it…overall. Glad to be back with Apple
639,"I bought this after my iPhone 6s battery died. I bought this phone and added a screen $10 protector and case immediately because I’m quite clumsy.I dropped my phone on vinyl flooring and oddly enough, my screen cracked but not the screen protector. When I brought it in for a repair the Apple technician said that the screen was a poor quality screen and it cost me $200 for a repair with a great screen.Now when I drop my phone 3 times a day the screen does not crack.I would have bought it somewhere else if I knew that the screen was a cheap repair."
640,"I got the phone earlier than expected !! I love it, it came with a charger block & cord. This was my first time purchasing a phone on Amazon. Everything on the phone works great.It had a few scratches around the edges of the camera and phone but it isn't noticeable. I’ll have a case on all the time. The battery life was 82%.I’ll try and do an update after a one or few more weeks."
641,We expected some flaws but there were none the company even sent it with a screen protector they go above and beyond I'll definitely a repeat customer
642,"A couple of misses on this phone. The sound when used as a phone is terrible, I can barely hear callers. Works fine on speaker phone or with other applications. I should have done more research before buying as the Find Me capability for airtags improved greatly the next year, this one is pretty pathetic. Come to think of it the accuracy of it knowing where itself is ranks worst of all the phones I've had.The face recognition is blinding fast, at first I thought it wasn't working as the phone was so quick at coming into action. Battery life is great although I have only given the phone limited use."
643,"I was very worried ordering a phone of amazon, I usually just stick to my provider but I didn’t wanna come out of $600 plus dollars so I literally read all the reviews and weighted my options and I’m very happy with my phone.! I only had it for about 2 weeks now but no issues, came brand new in my eyes and is working great! Will update in a month or so! But very glad I bought the phone ❤️"
644,"The phone is like new, you do not see any difference."
645,Good product
646,I bought a phone from these guys but the speaker didn’t work very well off speaker phone so I reached out to customer service. Not only did they work with me on how to return in order for me to keep this partially working phone until the new one arrived they  were VERY responsive each time I reached out. I’m impressed and happy everything went smoothly overall. No issues with replacement device.
647,"The phone looked great!  A couple of surface scratches on the top right of the screen, but that's to be expected I guess with a used phone.  I wasn't really concerned with those small issues. I transferred everything from my old phone and completely set up the new phone and everything was great!  I was soooo excited and felt really great about my purchase,.....until I made a call.  It wasn't until I had invested several hours into the new phone that I realized the ear speaker has a shattery sound and makes it difficult to hear the other person on the call.  The speaker does technically work, but the voice sounds muffled and shattered, like an old busted car speaker.  I really hate it because I like the phone and spent so much time setting everything up to be personalized to me.  If I new the quality of the speaker before hand, I would have returned it immediately, but at this point I think I will just deal with it.  I don't like change and it took me forever to upgrade from an Iphone 5S (crystal clear speaker btw) to the XR, and unfortunately it was just a bad experience because of the speaker issue.  The phone is excellent other than this one issue, but a key feature of the a phone is to have conversations with others right?  I needed this phone for my personal and business use, so I hope the speaker doesn't continue to degrade.I'm not sure how the company tests for sound quality and clarity, but I would encourage everyone if you decide to purchase a used phone, call someone on the phone first before personalizing it to you."
648,I love the new phone came fast for also it was really good price Phone stores near me charges double
649,"Simply amazing, Thanks Verizon."
650,The phone came in good condition. That battery was at 90%. When the phone first got here it was locked even though we purchased an unlocked phone. They were able to unlock it two days after we submitted the complaint.
651,Even though I am an amazon prime member and got this phone in 2 day shipping it took almost a month to be delivered. I contacted support various times and always got a different answer. CUSTOMER SUPPORT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK. The battery is at a 96% health capacity which is not 100% but ok I guess for the price. Other that that the phone works great and I would definetly buy again. Just wish Amazon would actually keep their word when they say it is 2 day shipping and that their customer service actually knows what they are doing.
652,It all works perfectly and I’m about to order a 3rd for my daughter….
653,"I just got this phone and while most everything was in relatively perfect condition, the speakers sound awful. Right out of the box they sound like they've been drowned. I would have been fine with below average sound quality but this is awful to listen to. The only reason I'm not asking for a replacement is because I can't be without a phone long enough for them to fix or replace it. Overall I haven't noticed any other issues but this is still a glaring problem even for a renewed phone."
654,I was a little Leary ordering this. But for $200 it is worth it ! Everything worked on it perfectly fine! It was like a brand new iPhone
655,"The phone looks brand new, works  completely fine. I’m very happy with my purchase."
656,Received phone just as advertised. Could not find any scratches on screen or on back of phone. So far phone is functioning perfectly. Happy with purchase.
657,"I didn't write a review right away after I got the product, so I'm writing one now. I did check everything to make sure the product worked after receiving. I do recommended checking the product thoroughly after receiving. I have had this phone for 8 months now and it has been working really well for me during that time. No phone crashes and the speakers on the device have been working well. The battery has held up well during this time (try to not let the battery life drop below 40% too many, can affect the battery health). Great thing about getting this product is I still have 4 more months on return policy if anything goes wrong. The amazon renewed premium product has held up well for me so far will try to make another review. Any questions please ask"
658,Overheats too easily but overall a very good purchase
659,iPhone was in excellent condition with 87% battery
660,"I ordered Iphone XR and I was so pleased with everything. Little scratch was there at the bottom but it was impossible to see. And I bought another Iphone XR again. But the battery was relatively bad compared to first phone, price has gone up after I purchase. But overall, it was good phone with no scratch or anything. I would have given 5 star if the second phone was same as the first one. Anyway, I would suggest this seller. Just cross your finger it is the best one or okay one!"
661,Shipping is very fastAnd the seller is cooperativeI recommend to buy
662,Refurbished phone was as described and was compatible with US Cellular service.
663,"I ordered a cell phone because my nephews said I needed one while driving just in case.  So with some help from one of them, I ordered the Apple iPhone XR, 128GB, Coral color.  The phone arrived well packaged and in great shape.  The price was good for a first time cell phone!!  I was under the impression that the phone would have the coral colored scene and not just all one color.  I have all one color, but since I do love the color, I will not return it.  But do wish the sellers would indicate exactly what the phone would look like, either all one color or a design.  Now to get a provider and plan and I'm good to go."
664,"This phone came in such great condition it’s hard to believe that anybody had ever used it.  Not a scratch or ding on it.  Works exactly as it is suppose to.  Came in great packaging, very professional and like you get when purchased new.  Highly recommend Renewed Premium."
665,The phone does not stay charged as long as my older phone which was several years old. Looks good. Did not come with “apple” charging block. Overall acceptable. My previous iPhone lasted 5 years with no problems. I hope this one holds up.
666,"The premium package is like buying a new cell Phone, I have wondered if they replace components such as the covers and perhaps the screen, it's that good. Battery was near 100%. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase."
667,Just what I was looking for... an older iphone model in mint condition for my daily use!
668,Came beautifully packed and no blemishes. Charged to 90% out of the box. Took immediately to T-Mobile and a tech set me up as I’m a long time customer of T-Mobile. Love this provider’s service and truth in their Amazon description. Thanks so much
669,After placing my order it arrived within 24 hours to my apartment in NYC. Wicked fast shipping time. Battery health was at 87% which isn’t great but definitely still useable. No scratches. Good value
670,                    The media could not be loaded.                 This was a recent purchase dome for me.The phone was in very good condition physically & I received a 6 ft fast charger in the package.Battery health was 89% which is good.The only issue I'm having is that the speaker is super low I have to constantly use speakerphone when I'm on a call & it's very inconvenient. I just reached out to the sellers so hopefully it can be sorted out!!
671,"What I liked about the purchase is that it had no scratches, dents, or minor cracks. It functions like as if, I bought it new from the apple store. And for its price it was well worth it. I have no dislike of the product that was sold."
672,"I just bought this phone a week ago and it has met all my expectations. The phone is fully functional and everything works perfectly. It's VERY close to new. The only way I could tell it was used was because it was at a solid 95% Battery Health. (the higher the battery health, the longer the phone runs on a single charge) Was looking for a phone that I could easily lock with my carrier, and I got it."
673,"Skeptical most definitely but no issues at all.. It came a day earlier than expected too that was great.  Phone looks brand new. The look on my daughters face was priceless when I gave it to her, she's been on it every since with no issues. The  battery is keeping a good charge as well. Five stars here"
674,Great product
675,First Premium phone I purchased was an Iphone XS in March of 2022.  Speaker stopped working after 6 months of the 1 year warranty and the same phone was not available so I ordered an Iphone 11 Pro for $300 more than the XS because the screen was suppose to be much better.  I could not see a difference from the XS so one day later I returned the 11 Pro.  Now Amazon says the the phone was missing from the original box.  It has been a night mare dealing with Amazon  with many phone calls.  I believe that these phones are sent to a third party for refurbishing and I suspect that is where  the phone was removed.  P.S. after getting the XR I returned the original bad XS and now 12 days later they show it was sent back but by Amaxon Hub in San Diego but has not arrived.  Again 3rd party?????  MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE AN EXPENSIVE PHONE OR ANY EXPENSIVE ITEM YOU LEAVE THE PACKAGE OPEN SO THE AMAZON RETURN CENTER CAN VERIFY THE ITEM BEFORE SEALING THE BOX.
676,"I purchased this phone about a month ago.  This was an upgrade from an iPhone 6.  It arrived without a scratch - you would never know from looking at it that it was a refurbished phone.  There wasn't a mark on it.  It was fun to have the space to download the apps that I like to use and have room left over.  I would highly recommend you buy a case at the time of purchase.  It's very slippery without it and I had to wait a month to get my case (even with Prime) because of the pandemic crisis.  It's much heavier and bigger than the 6 - feels nicer in the hand.  I would have given it a five star rating if the battery lasted the whole day.  It lasts about twelve hours.  I'm thinking maybe it doesn't have an original Apple battery in it and in addition, I'm constantly using while I'm furloughed from work  so take that into consideration."
677,This thing would be 5 stars except for the screen. It’s not cracked or anything just scuffed up. It came with a screen protector on it and I could see the one problem area scratch that is pretty noticeable. There’s some other fainter scratches that clearly came from the previous owner and I feel like a replacement should have been done but maybe that’s just me being overly picky. The battery came with 90% capacity and the rest of the phone looks brand new. If scratches annoy you beware or be prepared to look for a place to try and get it replaced for a decent price.
678,Overall this was a really good purchase. I bought this phone for my daughter that has been using it for a little over a week now and so far it has been working great! Had a few small scratches but nothing too bad and the battery life was ok. I’m planning on purchasing another one soon.
679,"Came as expected, works just as new. Battery life great. Happy purchase."
680,"I bought this phone an early 2020 basically when the pandemic started because I had a 6Plus. It is still working perfectly fine, it has been through a lot. The battery life is slowly starting to die faster but other than that I have had no problems. Still in use 😁"
681,The package arrive at the right time very good song and the phone was in good condition everything work good
682,I am very Satisfied with the product!!
683,Excellent I will be back for my next upgrade
684,"It’s amazing, exactly what I asked for. It does a bit of goofy things like it says bluetooth is turned off until tomorrow or WiFi is turned off until tomorrow but it works just fine. It works exactly how it should and there were no damages I could see besides the screen having some light scratches on it that you wouldn’t even notice until you shined it up at the light. Absolutely perfect so far!"
685,Una bocina no suena y la batería dura pero no tanto como lo esperado por lo demás está todo bien
686,"Was skeptic that it wouldn’t be unlocked, however it was. And was in great condition. My BF likes and needed it. Would buy again."
687,i think it word's pretty good battery decent but it hade some scratches on the screen but otherwise i love it and it works just fine❤️
688,"I bought an Apple iPhone XR, 128GB, Black - Unlocked (Renewed Premium), sold and shipped by Amazon.  I paid about $55 extra to get the Amazon ""Renewed Premium"" rather than the Third-party ""Excellent Condition"" renewed phone because the former guaranteed at least a 90% battery health, while the latter guaranteed only >80%.After spending an entire day configuring the iPhone for my account and getting everything set up properly, I checked the Battery Health.  It is only 85%.  Although the phone has no scratches on either the case or the screen and it looks great, I feel like I've been ripped-off because I paid extra to ensure that I'd get a great level of battery health.  I didn't.I don't want to return the iPhone because it took so much effort to set up - and I'd have no assurance that I wouldn't get the same result with a replacement.  I feel Amazon should credit my account the $69 it will cost to replace the battery.I'm very disappointed in Amazon's service, which is a very rare occurrence.  I have usually had terrific success buying renewed goods from them in the past.  They dropped the ball in this case.  Beware!"
689,I bought it for someone so didn’t check the face recognition and other qualities but love it and will buy again
690,"I was skeptical about buying a renewed iPhone, but the phone was in pretty good condition besides a few light scratches on the screen. once I place a temper glass screen protector on it you don't even notice it at all. Battery life is decent for a renewed phone at 82% capacity. And the phone came unlocked as described. Will be ordering another phone soon from this seller!"
691,Thank youFast shipping and good condition
692,"Shipping was really fast, phone is in pristine condition. Started right up and was able to put my SIM card in and it worked great. Battery life is 82% and it seems to last just fine. Some small domestic scratches on the phone itself but I personally don’t care about that. I was nervous buying it but so far it works great!! Very satisfied."
693,"Man of Man where do I start??... I must say that I searched high and low for an affordable iPhone for my son birthday as he wanted to switch over from android and join the apple world like his Dad and I. That is when I landed on this baby right here. I have never been one very fond of renew devices because of how the appearance might look of issues with the device itself, but upon receiving this device from Amazon it blew my expectations out of the water. I was completely amazed by how like-new this device looked it came with a screen protector and case and a 90 day warranty guarantee what else more can a mother asked for. My son was over joyed ands loved his phone which made me really happy to know that it put a smile on my face as well as his. I will definitely be using amazon in the future for device purchases."
694,Bought this phone not really knowing what to expect since it was a renewed phone. I was so happy when it arrived. This phone looks brand new. There's not a scratch on it and it works perfectly. The price is also lower then I was able to find anywhere else. I'm totally loving this phone. It also arrived a couple days early too. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
695,"iPhone is in great condition, I loved my product, came surgiu 84% battery life"
696,"Overall, the IPhone was in pretty good shape, but the screen had some defects, for example, the top piece has lots of light scratches on it, at first you don’t really notice them, but if you look closely, you’ll see all these scratches from who-knows-what at the top. Secondly, there is a small white transparent dot on the middle left portion of the screen, like if some sort of heavy pressure was put on the screen itself. Doesn’t really bother me that much, but from time to time my eyes would catch a glimpse of the dot. Other than that though, the phone itself runs really smooth, has a great battery life, I could use it almost a whole 24 hours without charging it, and it only takes 35-45 minutes to fully charge. Overall, though the screen is not in perfect shape, the phone is extremely useful, smooth, convenient, and long-lasting."
697,"Love the phone, it looks brand new however you said it was unlocked which is a lie. The phone is locked, gonna have to spend extra to have open."
698,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Todo excelente, la batería llegó con un 85%"
699,Recomiendo adquirir equipo aquí no se decepcionarán.
700,I have not yet set up the face recognition.  The battery life is 98%.  The phone looks like new and works great.
701,"I was in need of a new phone and wanted to stick with an IPhone. I was not willing to pay hundreds of dollars. The phone arrived like new, easily transferred all of my data. It has a great battery life as well. I have recommended others to look into this versus buying new. Thank you for making this possible."
702,"El cargador es genérico, el teléfono está con 85% de batería es aceptable"
703,"Everything on this phone seems to work fine except the speaker quality and the battery life. The phone I bought was refurbished. My daughters had both bought themselves one new so I had something to compare them to. I have used Motorola for years and LOVE the sound quality. But I am less than satisfied for sure with my XR sound quality both with and without using the speaker. Using speaker, no one can really understand what I’m saying and using the earpiece I can hardly hear anyone else. Battery life is also much less than I expected since my daughters phone will last them 2 or 3 days and they’re never off of them. Mine will barely last a day and I use mine at least half as much."
704,Thank you.
705,okay
706,All of the above
707,I brought this iPhone for my grandson because he lost his phone.  He’s very happy and thankful.
708,Good overall if your lucky ig
709,Absolutely amazing!!! Get it! I love this phone! Practically brand new!!
710,"When I started shopping for an iphone, I had no idea that 'XR' existed.  I bought it refurbished, at a great price, and I love it!  Screen quality is beautiful, refresh rate is excellent, battery life is awesome, everything about it is great!  Love the phone."
711,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Needed a business phone & this XR is PERFECT. Works just like new, camera is great, speaker is great, and it’s compatible with T-Mobile. I’ve had this phone for almost a month, so far so good. 👍🏾Only flaw is sometimes face recognition doesn’t work but it’s not a big deal for me. I received exactly what I paid for."
712,It’s like brand new
713,"I was a die-hard android fan, until I bought this iPhone. The XR is big and a nice weight. Out of box beautiful...as you can from the pics. I am still working through the differences in Apple products and Microsoft products. The only thing I don't like is there is no plug-in head phone capability and you can't download your music to the phone itself, but those are things I can live without easily as everything is cloud-based. Great buy and I bought it here at a fraction of the cost on the Apple site, I really like that especially. For those switching to Apple products watch your data use, you may have to purchase more data as Apple products use a lot of data, so take your phone off data while you have Wi-Fi access. The major thing I like about the switch is I will not be buying a new phone every two or three years!!!!"
714,
715,It was scratches on the phone
716,"Only down fall is that the only thing that was wring with my old phone was that the charging port does not work properly all the time, and turns out i bought a new phone with the same problem. Other than that New phone functions great. Clean phone, keyboard work and so does new features compared to the iphone 8"
717,"it was 64 GB, it was coral colored, and I did indeed receive an iPhone XR that was carrier unlockedif you want a review on the device itself:its fairly durable, but get a case anywayits not going to hang or slow down in most tasksits very comfortable to hold in my rather small handsthe 12 megapixel outer camera works great! takes love ly photossupports the latest version of iOS (as of now) as well as most features of the latest versionflashlight is not the brightest I've seen, but it will help you find things in the dark both inside and outside of your housemicrophone quality is great! I've never had trouble with my words being recognized.screen has good brightness. its visible at max in daylight, and the resolution is not the best for an iPhone, but its good enough that you wont know the difference unless you look close.speakers are okay, but I suggest using headphones if you wanna listen to music."
718,"I purchased this iPhone to replace a XR with only 64 gb and a battery operating at around 80%. After a lengthy consideration and some trepidation, I placed my order. It arrived more quickly than anticipated and it looks like a new phone. After doing an IOS update and setting it up from an iCloud backup, I couldn’t be more satisfied; with battery life or its operation, because it’s a new quality iPhone at half the price."
719,"Face recognition was good, really good, and the battery life was 92% I wish it were 100% but I have more storage from my old phone that the new one could handle so my phone was trying to back up for about 36 hours now. So make sure your storage from your old one can be transferable to the new one. My message weren’t loading or saving, I couldn’t take pictures, and iCloud was giving me an issue with trying to trouble shoot the phone. But overall it’s a really good phone"
720,I purchased four of these phones for my children. This was the lowest price I found anywhere for this current of a phone. All of the phones set up easily. All of the phones looked and worked as new. And my kids were totally stoked with these.
721,"I bought this one to compare with a ""non-premium"" version of this same phone. To my surprise, this was in worse condition.  I have returned on October 14th. Today is November 4th, still no refund.  Very disappointed, never had any issues with refund before."
722,"Phone arrived with descriptions as minor scratches, upon closer look and feel I found it was a hairline crack across the bottom , not noticeable at first glance, but as used I could feel it and it gets very hot and battery life is not very long"
723,He loved it
724,"there are a few dents and scratches on the side, but other than that i haven’t had any issues yet."
725,"Honestly, no cap, this is a brand new phone. It didn’t come in the Apple box, but the battery life is at 99% (it was about 35% charged, not that it matters).  No scratches or anything.I’m just a dude from Ohio living in Atlanta, and I’d recommend Amazons refurbished stuff to anyone after doing this purchase.I’m not rich, so I was skeptical, but now I’m glad I upgraded from my 6s to the Coral XR.(I’m not taking pics, cause I’m in bed rn, but trust me. Phone looks and basically is brand new. I just know how I was reading a bunch of reviews and hoping Everything would turn out alright.)All in all, I’m glad. Worst case scenario would’ve been using their return policy and getting another sent to me, so 🙏🏽 I’m grateful that didn’t happen.Choose your color & style, and just take the plunge. It’ll be worth it. Amazon practically guarantees it."
726,It’s really looking like new and everything is working probably if there’s anything happened within 90 Days I’m going to add and update to this review
727,"The product works really well. I needed to replace my Galaxy S10 after it had some motherboard damage so I decided to switch back to Apple since I had a Mac.It came in and looked new. I was skeptical at first since its my first refurbished, but the product's battery holds me up the whole day, the apps run fairly well, and the camera quality is as good as any iphone its model. The only issue I have with it is the speakers. If I blast it, the sound quality does change but thats just as long as I dont put it to the max sound setting.Edit: I’m back several many months later writing this review and it still works great. In fact, I’m writing on the same device I bought. The gps/data/everything works as if I just bought a new phone"
728,Muy buena calidad compré ya dos veces este teléfono y funciona de maravilla estoy pensando en comprar otro 😃
729,"Shipped via fedex 2day ground. Ordered on Sunday and received on Wednesday. Phone arrived in near excellent condition except for a very minor scratch on the frame and minor scuffs on the back glass. Screen appears to be Apple so the True Tone display still works (non Apple replacements don’t allow true tone to work). The battery was also at 94% capacity. Face ID, cameras, speakers, etc everything works flawlessly. It seems the previous owner bought this phone used it for 6 months and then decided to get a new one. I was on the fence reading the reviews but for the price I got it versus what I would’ve paid at the Apple store, this was a no brainer. I feel like I got a brand new phone. It seems different sellers have different results. If you buy this, buy it from seller MOBILESUPPLY you won’t be disappointed."
730,"Got a red renewed 128gb XR, ""CPOCell""  was the seller I got it from. Phone is in perfect condition, an amazing upgrade from my 4+ year old iPhone 6s. The battery life was at 100% which I was VERY pleased with because in the description it said batteries could work at 80% capacity on arrival. I will totally consider buying the amazon renewed iPhones again in the future when I need my next upgrade, can't tell a difference from a brand new iPhone from the Apple store compared to this refurbished one. The ones from there with the same storage run you $650 and mine with tax came to just under $500. I saved about $200 on this which is definitely worth it to me.Note: It comes with a stock charger (not apple) which I don't mind because it works fine and no included headphones, but that was stated in the product description so it's a non issue.I will update the review if there are any issues!"
731,"I was really skeptical about buying this iPhone Xr because of some of the reviews but received mine in brand new condition. There were no scratches on the front back or either camera, it turned on perfectly fine and was unlocked. The iPhone came with a clear protective case and screen protector. The battery life is great, with my being in school i listen to music all day ad i never have to charge the phone throughout the day. Definitely recommend"
732,This phone is an upgrade from My IPhone 8.  It was unlocked to all carriers and I had no issues connecting to Tracfone.  it was in good condition and even came with a screen protector. A good but for my money.  I would buy from this vendor again.
733,"When I jus got the phone the camera around the back had some scratches on it,The phone is freezing when going on safari but otherwise from that it ok"
734,"i know a lot of people are a little sketchy when it comes to these types of things. but it all depends on the seller. look for high ratings. my face id works great, the phone came on time and shipped fast, i was able to transfer everything over from my 7 plus to this phone. It is unlocked. i had no problems with my carrier. phone came with scratches but they weren’t noticeable at all until i really looked. the glass both back and front are perfect. no dents at all. just waiting on a case. the battery life came at 92% which is great until i have to get a new battery next year. CPRTX was my seller, their communication was fast and i would HIGHLY recommend getting their phones. LOOK AT THE SELLER. the description stays the same but the seller can change guys."
735,"phone from Amazon was perfect as always, we have purchased 3 phones in recent years, all were flawless and were in new condition"
736,"My phone came in good condition, no marks or dings. Just one things i wonder why (no mater where you buy a refurbished phone) don’t they clean the screen for the ear piece speaker????!! Must be hard to replace.This seller sends out great phones for a great price. I needed a new phone in a pinch, got mine the next day."
737,XR came unlocked and was in excellent condition! The price was awesome $250. Thank you!
738,"this refurbished phone is awesome! i got mine from ChubbiesTech out of NY and it was perfect! I had almost no trouble switching my service with metropcs from my 6S to the XR. it came on time and looks great! the battery capacity is 100%, and besides one little dent (that i only saw because i LOOKED for it) you wouldn't even be able to tell that the phone wasn't brand new! hopefully phone stays good, but as of now i couldn't have hoped for a better experience with the phone & seller! fedex on the other hand, that's a different story😂EDIT: this phone, while it connected to my carrier, will not stay connected to service. it will say i'm connected, but none of the cellular features or data features will work. i've done everything that has been recommended to me (download apn, reset network settings, get a new sim card) and NOTHING has fixed the problem. as soon as i actually get a response from the seller, i plan to exchange it.EDIT 2: The seller i got my phone from, ChubbiesTech, was super helpful and setme up with a new phone no problem! the second phone worked perfectly, and i'm very happy with my purchase. Forgot to update before, but i'd definitely say that this is a good way to get a new phone for cheaper!"
739,I had to put all my data from my android on the cloud before th Iphone transfer app would work. They should tell people that.  Now that I got that fixed. the phone works
740,"I don't have a photo of the phone bc I'm typing on it, but as for the quality for the price, it's 100x better to go for this, it's 5-31-2021 and I've had this phone for 2-3 weeks and it performs far better than I anticipated, there were small scuff marks on the camera edge, but it didn't interfere with the photo quality at all. Most likely just from everyday usage, but do keep in mind that it's refurbished, not new, so it won't be perfect, but I know this $380 phone vs the $700 new one is far far better. (For those concerned about the quality, I have no scratches on my screen or lens, not a bit of lag between multiple apps, and no issue with battery life, because trust me I was just as concerned and took a leap of faith)"
741,"i’d definitely say it was a gamble, i seen everyone talk about no scratches and 100% battery life but eh, mine came with like 92% and there’s like a few (probably 3) minimal scratches that’s covered by my case but the screen is perfect and the camera is okay (i honestly think its average but i dont take much pics) and its fine tbh, i kinda wanna return and get a brand new one since the price is pretty close especially w shipping & handling but id say its worth it. everything abt the phone is nice and it came before it was supposed to."
742,"Updated*** Arrived early, well packaged, no external issues, only a few very light scratches on front screen, none on back. Problem was with activation. Advertised as an unlocked for any carrier. However T-Mobile/sprint unable to activate this unlocked phone. The IMEI # was for a prepaid phone, so unable to use.  Wall plug and cord worked! Waiting on a replacement to arrive.  Refund issued, got unlocked replacement and same issue, unable to activate, returned and got a refund, bought another coral colored this time locked for T-Mobile/Sprint. Arrived early, great condition with a screen protector installed. Works great, no complaints. So after all the fiasco, unlocked phones will not work for T-Mobile/Sprint, locked ones to them will."
743,I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone on Amazon but I’m so glad I did!!  This phone works perfectly and set up was super easy!  I am very satisfied!!
744,"It has Amazing battery life, It doesn't have a scratch on the screen. THe screen quality is great."
745,It works wonderfully
746,Bought 2 iPhone XR’s and the both work like new!
747,Took it to T-Mobile and a few minutes later wow!  It has been a couple of weeks and so far perfect.
748,You should buy it
749,I bought it and I felt worried but the phone exceeded my expectations it came with 92 and 95 battery percent(I ordered 2) and it came with a screen protector I thought the screen was elevated but I figured out it was a fitted screen protector definitely would buy again
750,Phone looked brand new. There was not a scratch on it. The only way I could tell it was not brand-new is by checking the maximum battery capacity. It showed to be 89% which is very good for a used phone. Everything works great and I am very satisfied.
751,"This is such a good phone! I have not noticed any scratches or problems with it since I had it! It works so well, and I am really glad I did not listen to the bad reviews. I really recommend this:))"
752,"Absolutely Everything works as expected. Packing and documentation cover the basic needs of the phone. Great care, great device, great company."
753,Was not compatible with Tracfone even though it was advertised that it was.  Nice phone!!!
754,Battery at 80% life. Screen doesn’t seem like the original and glitches enough to keep scrolling up (like tapping the top of your screen to see the top of the webpage or your texts type deal) or the brightness and volume widget in the control center don’t work. Little tap on the top right corner fix’s the scrolling and a hard reset (volume up then down and holding the power button) fixes control center issue
755,good product
756,"Phone came in a day early and is in great condition. There are no scratches, unlocked and transitioned smoothly. I would definitely buy from seller again!!"
757,"So far, this refurbished I phone is working great.  Looks brand new.  Received the item in just a few days.  Really thought we would be waiting awhile for it."
758,Love the Color♥️.
759,Love it
760,It was cool glad about the color because it’s a light blue and everything works and super happy with it!
761,"This product definitely varies from seller to seller and phone to phone, but mine came in perfect condition. There is not a single scratch on the screen, feels brand new, and my battery life is at 91% max capacity."
762,Phone came pretty quick. It is in good condition. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I had a bit of a problem with the phone not reading the SIM card.
763,I was a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished iPhone from Amazon. This is a gift for an12 year old and really didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a phone. The phone was well packaged and arrived earlier than expected! It was like a brand new phone and had no imperfections! I simply installed the old SIM card in the new phone and it worked wonderfully!
764,Good quality. Good price. No scratches on the screen 90 days to return it. Works good and fast. Shipping was a day early. I would buy another refurbished item from amazon. Well worth the money
765,"At first I was a little iffy ordering this from Amazon, especially a refurbished one. But it's PERFECT! No damage whatsoever and I got a LifeProof case for it 😁"
766,It’s a nice phone for a good price. Nothing is wrong with it and it did meet my expectations.
767,"The phone only works well when it’s connected to wifi… I got It for T-Mobile servers and it never works, I always have no service unless I’m on the Wi-Fi and get weird warning pop ups on my phone like the ones provided. The stress isn’t worth it just get a new phone so you know it’ll actually work. I’m very disappointed with this purchase."
768,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍great phone also in geat condition
769,"I was looking all over Amazon for a new phone (cos other stores are too expensive for me) and they all had pretty bad reviews. This one I can 100% recommend. Came with a charger and a charger block. DOESNT COME WITH HEADPHONES, which for me is fine, it’s a cheap iPhone off of Amazon what do you expect. It came in the mail around 2pm and I’m writing this at 8pm, with me on it that whole time it’s on only 30%. Which I can say is better than my old phone which I got from Verizon. The only thing I would say is bad about it is the box and bag it came in, the phone itself was kinda just thrown in (?) no real protection from it cracking. Just keep that in mind if your local mailing service isn’t careful with packages."
770,Buen excelente la batería 95 cel esta nuevo
771,phone was received in excellent (like new) condition
772,"I was hesitant to buy a phone from Amazon, but I am happy with my purchase! I purchased two phones and so far they are great!!"
773,"The phone is pretty good for the price. The only issue is that the speaker only goes to about 1/2 volume. Higher than that it is no louder, just more distorted. Works fine with headphones though."
774,"It is a brand new phone! As it states it doesn’t come in an apple box or accessories but I’m in love with my new phone! I’ve been telling everyone about this deal, I even ordered another one for my fiancée. No complaints at all if you are skeptical don’t be it is a great value! And it comes with a 90 warranty through Amazon."
775,"Phone must have been used by a very responsible person or the techs performing the renewal process are very skilled. Either way, this phone could have come out of brand new Apple packaging and I would not have known the difference."
776,"Only comment is that the packaging left me nervous cause it was a box much bigger than the phone and the phone itself was just in bubble wrap. However, I have zero complaints otherwise. Came with a charger black and cord, even came with the little tool to open your SIM card so I didn’t have to dig for a paper clip"
777,Good phone. Had to get it since my old iphone started acting up. Came in quick and on time.  Now to see how long it will last.
778,"Even though it’s renewed it’s the Perfect phone. It looks brand new, no scratches came with a screen protector  just like new. I’m in love with it best decision ever ! Being Unlocked was a plus just put in my sim and it registered. I loveeeeeeee!!"
779,I love it it works great and it’s a good price I was a bit scared that it wouldn’t work cause there was a lot of bad reviews but it works really well love it
780,I have to give it a 5 star⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ review since the iphone📲 is in perfect condition👌🏻 and works perfect 💯%recommended!!! We are so happy🥳🥳🥳🥳
781,This phone works perfect and looks great! its a new phone.
782,"The reviews made us super nervous but Amazon prime would refund if any issues anyway so we took the chance. So glad we did. Beautiful phone, works great. BUT. there was several scratches on the screen and the back glass as well. Pretty deep. Too many to count, with a tempered glass and case you don’t even see them so it’s not a big deal was just a little disappointing. It also came with a tempered glass and case which we were unaware of so he has an extra set at least which is pretty cool. The phone also might have connectivity issues as it loses mobile date at times for some reason and has to have the sim taken out and put back in. Other than that it’s great"
783,I’ve have this phone about 4 months now…. No problems… good camera quality !!!
784,"Phone came as described and better but as a hole the phone is not that good I’d look into other brands for my next phone but will be using this company again!Update: after 6 months the phone has gotten worse, *Not the sellers fault* the XR is a total piece of 💩 and will not recommend to anyone"
785,I am very satisfied with the product that I brought from Amazon my iPhone came in a generic box but it works like it’s brand new I’ve been having my phone for about two months it has not have any issues with it very pleased with my order. I was also satisfied with the amount that I spent for my phone.
786,"I was a bit wary about buying a used phone. But this one is perfect: not a scratch or ding anywhere. Really easy to set up, and the battery really holds up. I’ve read reviews of other sellers, and they were a mixed bag. This seller really delivers."
787,"It's worth it to pay a little extra for the ""Renewed Premium"". It gets you better battery life from the beginning! They tell you a minimum of 90%. Well, it took 3 times/phones to get the 90%!! BUT Amazon worked with me to get what I paid for. I LOVE Amazon Prime!!!!"
788,"The speaker is so much clearer and easier to hear than my old phone.  It’s in perfect shape,  I love it!!!"
789,Only thing I had to get used to was no home button like android has.Got this as a backup phone but it's so good I use it as my main
790,"Phone was in excellent condition, very happy with this purchase."
791,Todo me agrado menos la falla mínima que tenia
792,"I have bought it for my son. His first iphone. Screen is the size of Iphone 10, great quality. but most important is great price! delivered fast."
793,After more than 90 days the phone stopped recognizing the sim card.  Took the phone and sim card into my cellular provider and they said that its more than likely from previous water damage because the sim card works absolutely fine in any other phone that it was put into and the phone definitely was not dropped into any water after purchase.  I was recommended to take it into an Apple store and pay for possible repairs or to just purchase a new phone altogether.
794,"I was skeptical about getting this phone but I’m so happy that I did! It can in great condition, it’s battery life is phenomenal, and I’ve had no problems with it. I’ve been using the phone for a couple of months now. I’d suggest this company to anyone."
795,"Okay, so I'm super skeptical about buying stuff online. I gave it a try and I'm so happy with the results. So here is my back story my daughter dropped my old iPhone 8 plus on the ground and in water so I of course had to get a new phone. I wanted an upgraded iPhone and I came across this iPhone on Amazon and found this iPhone on sale. I read all reviews, and decided to purchase it. I received it not 1 but 2 days earlier then what shipping said I would. I went straight from work to daycare for pickup to Metro PCS, They activated my phone for me, and transferred my current plan. It was so easy and so quick. I'm so happy!!! Also what came in the box, a pamphlet on how to, a charger and not apple but works perfect, and the iPhone and the sim card tray tool thing. Shipping was perfect, delivery was perfect. I want to give you 10 million stars . Thank you so much for anyone that made the process this easy!!!!"
796,The only “complaint” I have is that the update I needed to do before I actually transferred my data took a while but once it downloaded everything was great
797,En general funciona bien
798,I purchase this phone for my niece because her phone was broken and she had an iPhone 8 Plus so I upgraded her phone to this one she loves it she only had it for a few weeks but she is loving it a lot
799,"Some background: I have had the phone for one week. My previous phone was an iPhone SE, so this was a huge upgrade. I am a masters student balling on a budget. I typically keep a phone for 3 to 4 years (until it completely stops working) so I was looking for a bargain without substituting quality.Better than I ever could have hoped! The iPhone XR arrived a day early (even in a time of pandemic) in a generic box with a generic charging cord. I put in my SIM card and set up the phone in less than an hour- no issues. I checked the battery health and it is at 97% capacity. I expect like with most iPhones that the battery lifespan will be about 2-3 years before I must replace it. I am very happy with this! No broken buttons, screen damage or anything! For over $150 in savings compared to a new device, I am blown away by the quality. I will never buy a new phone again- I will use BuySPRY refurbished phones."
800,Good phone has no issues
801,"I purchased this phone for my son. My delivery came earlier than expected. The phone was in excellent condition, like new and the battery life lasts all day while he's in school."
802,It’s great it came 3 days earlier is good
803,"It just arrived today, and on time. I was afraid it would be poor quality from looking at other reviews, but thankfully it worked out well! The area around the camera lens is a bit scuffed up, but that’s no issue for me. There’s no scratches on the phone that I’ve noticed and the battery is at 83% health! Will update if I have any issues, but for now I’m satisfied! I ordered from Hybrid It"
804,"Great price,great phone,looks new. Since amazon would not re post my review,this will be the LAST I ever submit!"
805,"My phone is everything I hoped it would be, very happy!"
806,"Excellent condition, accepted Visible SIM card without issue"
807,Phone works great. My daughter is very happy with it. It does everything it’s supposed to do.
808,La batería llego con una capacidad del 95%La detención de respuesta del táctil de la pantalla es de 100% muy buena respuestaLa calidad de la pantalla el el punto más débil del equipo ya que es LCD los colores no son muy buenos muy baja relación por píxel .. ya que no es una pantalla de ultima generación como las pantallas súper amolec en calidad de pantalla pongo 7 de 10 ya que la resolución muy baja los colores muy planos los blancos son muy cálidos y el negro muy gris ..La calidad en la que vino el equipo muy buena diría que excelentelomas importante el equipo vino totalmente desbloqueado y libre de iCloud  para cualquier red Solo llevo 3 día el equipo está ahora va bien  lo seguirte probando para ver su comportamiento ya que dieron 90 día de garantía
809,Good
810,No dislikes at the moment . Everything works on it . Connected right to the WiFi . System updated perfect.  Screen was is good condition a few real minor scratches on back nothing noticeable unless really looking daughter loves it so I’m happy with it.  And also works as unlocked carriers. Have tracfone on it everything works good too.
811,Like brand new and still in use with no problems at all.
812,"Everything about the phone is great. I really love it a lot but my sound for phone calls does not work. I am able to hear the person on the other end but they are not able to hear me. It gives off rocky sounds. I was very saddened by it. Now ill have to wait again for another phone. Hopefully, the seller can respond quickly and give me a phone that fully works."
813,Bought this iPhone XR in Black from the seller Verizon Pre Owned and Its great! looks brand new with a 96% battery capacity. Highly recommend buying this Phone.
814,"This phone was a good value for upgrading from my old iPhone 6plus, which I couldn't upgrade the IOS.  It worked perfectly and I was able to clone my old iPhone onto it following Youtube instructions.  The battery status showed 84%, which is adequate for my needs."
815,I loved the phone. The only downfall was that my camera came messed up the back camera wont focus at all everything is blurry and fizzy.
816,"Shipping was really quick, for one. It got delivered before its expected delivery date. I ordered a red iPhone XR with 128GB memory space. I knew it was a renewed product so I expected at least some minor scratches on the phone. To my surprise, the phone is immaculate. It shines beautifully, no dings, scratches, or scuffs in the slightest. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones for this, but I hope all of you get the same experience as well. Performance wise, it's lightning quick (for reference, I'm upgrading from an iPhone 7), the battery life is insanely good. It's been at 100% charge for the last half hour while in use. It doesn't heat up like my 7 does (not yet at least. So far it's been staying very cool). The camera is awesome. Should make for some good shots. It feels and performs like a brand new phone in every way. Highly recommend the buy. I'm happy with mine, and I hope you guys will be happy with yours too. Cheers."
817,                    The media could not be loaded.                 It had a crack on the screen
818,Looks and acts like a brand new phone! Never buying new again!
819,"The phone functions well so far. Have updated the operating system and no problems transferring apps from my Moto phone. The battery life seems ok.The ad suggested that no imperfections can be seen at arms length. That is almost true except 3-4 fairly heavy scratches in the upper right hand corner of the front glass that are obvious at arms length. Since they don't seem to affect the overall functionality, I elected to keep the phone."
820,"Im a real person and I was hesitant to trying a refurb phone from Amazon but I’m so glad I did . Phone arrived very quickly, in near perfect shape and also included charger and cable. Chubbiestech also included a free case and screen protector!  Battery power at 93% capacity and it came fully unlocked and I had no problem getting my SIM card on Sprint to work with it. Everything running smoothly. I am quite glad to have taken a risk as my old s7 edge was starting to really die.  Since it’s Amazon renewed you get a 90 day warranty so that also feels good. I’m very happy with seller and my purchase and it’s also good for the environment. Hopefully this will last me for at least a few years . Excited to own my first iPhone!"
821,I love this phone even tho I got it with a few chips here and there the screen is still nice and the case covers the chips. The battery life is kinda iffy for me I don’t know exactly how long it lasts but if you pull it out only a couple times throughout the day it will last. Overall nice phone.
822,
823,The item was high-standard and exceptional! The packaging was very pleasing. First-class delivery. five stars
824,It’s literally brand new
825,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7+ and like most iPhones, it was an easy transition! Simply align your camera to the code and everything is transferred in minutes. Definitely enjoy the better battery life and the facial recognition is awesome! I thought the finger print scan was convenient, but now I only have to be looking at my phone to easily make purchases, insert passwords, etc. I’m always a few years behind with technology, but this is a big step up from past models!"
826,"Packaged well and it looked brand new! At first i was skeptical about it but after i received it, it was amazing. They even sent a free phone case with it. It fit my budget as well. When you go into buying these things always look at the reviews and trust your instincts but i would buy from these guys again :)"
827,"Im a first time IPhone user and this was a good experience. The screen looks good the pictures aren't top quality but it still takes great photos and the battery is perfect for my daily use. The only con I have is sometimes the response to the touch feedback dosent work perfectly, other than that the price was well worth it."
828,I purchased 2 of these phones and they work as if they’re brand new. No complaints at all and  they’re packaged very well.
829,"it came in near perfect condition for a renewed phone. no scratches or dings, it has good charging. glad I decided to buy it, saved quite a bit of money going this route. I was a little worried at first."
830,"def should buy, Im 16 and was allowed to get a phone, i was nervous about getting a referbished phone. Scared that i'd get scammed and my parents would get mad but its in great shape. Not a single scratch. Don't listen to the negative reviews. One of my best purchases!"
831,"Basically no defects found on phone surface and the battery's life is ~90%, this exceeded my expectation"
832,"This phone did not meet my expectations. I wanted a reliable battery, and one that lasts me longer than my previous phone. I’ve seen reviews for this phone, when it’s new or renewed, and this phone is screwed up. The battery was given to me years old.Also, another thing to mention, the speakerphone on this phone is messed up as well, so I can’t watch videos or make phone calls without my AirPods. I’ve tried customer support multiple times, they’ll just ignore you. Not what it says on their support card."
833,I was extremely nervous about purchasing this online but it arrived early in the original apple box with not a single nick or scratchIt looked brand new out of the box. I'm very GREATFUL this was for my daughter's 13th birthday. I will be using this seller in the future. I'm very satisfied!
834,"I like the fact they give you a warranty. The phone came with no damage, works like it’s brand new, and also came with a charger. My teenage daughter is very happy and so am I!"
835,This phone looked like new. It holds a charge well and works exactly as it should. I’m buying another today.
836,"I was so nervous!!! But I am so relieved, I got the right space, the phone looks beautiful, my battery life is 98%. Overall it’s GREAT and has no problems"
837,"I was a bit skeptical purchasing a used (renewed) iPhone, but the phone I received is exactly as described in the advertisement on Amazon.  There is a very very slight scratch in the upper right corner.  You need to hold the phone at a close distance and at a certain angle to see it.  The advertisement mentioned minimal cosmetic  damage, which is not noticeable at arms length.  The ad also guaranteed to have a minimum battery capacity of 80%.  On inspection, my battery is 100%, and the phone is still covered by Apple warranty.  I am satisfied with my purchase and the phone is in excellent condition. Some buyers are giving the seller low reviews because of the generic charger, cable and missing headphones.  The following was taken directly from the advertisement:  “Box and accessories (no headphones included) may be generic”.  Some people refuse to be responsible for their actions, and always look for others to blame.  Don’t blame the seller because you failed to read and understand the advertisement."
838,Got Pranked but in the end the phone is perfect. Works perfect. Only downfall is the battery percentage not 100% but its manageable.
839,I like it
840,"the phone works at a very good price and im glad i found it, you should get it"
841,"Arrived with some icons on phone, but an easy reset. Battery life is not great"
842,"Everything was perfect until I went to use the back camera. It's blurry and the camera shakes and makes a weird static sound. Besides that, there were no scratches, dents, or cracks, and the battery was at 85%. As someone who loves taking pictures, this won't work for me and I would like to get a replacement."
843,"I purchased my iPhone about a month and a half ago and I couldn't be happier. The battery life was at 90% when I bought it and it really keeps a charge. It didn't have a scratch on it, and even came with a screen saver. It was a great purchase!"
844,"I received my XR, 256GB Black, two days ago to replace two iPhone 6 64GB units I have used since 2015. It has been worth every cent! I wanted dual SIM (one physical SIM card and one eSIM) and it works flawlessly on the two completely different networks I use (one for my local country and the other my roaming number from my home country). The device arrived in a generic box and with a generic Lightning cable (which looks and feels much better than the original Lightning cable from Apple) as indicated by the seller but the unit itself is like new. I even have Apple Care for one year from the date of purchase. There is not a scratch or blemish anywhere to be found, whether on the front or back.The XR is obviously a huge step forward from the 6, which is starting to show its age. At the price I paid, this is an exceptional bargain, so I purchased two identical devices so that my SO does not feel left out."
845,"Product arrived earlier than expected, it works in the Verizon network, no issues with the IMEI or the phone. Only thing I would state that the phone is refurbished so there are scratches on the screen and you can tell it’s a replacement screen rather than the original screen on the phone and the max battery on it is only 80%, but truly can’t complain too much for what you pay for the product when you don’t need to go to Verizon directly!"
846,"I didn't know what to expect with a refurbished phone. So, when I got it, the only damage I saw was on the back where something had made a partial ring on the case. Otherwise, everything worked. All the information on my old iphone transfered over without a problem. Finally, put the Sim card into the XR phone. Now, I just have to get used to using it."
847,"Took a chance on a used phone for my Mom’s upgrade. The phone arrived fast and well packaged. The phone met expectations and as described by the seller-no original charger/accesories. The phone had a few minor scratches as seen in the pictures but its all cosmetic; as far as functionality it has worked very well. The scratches cant even be noticed when you keep your phone in a good case anyway. We had an easy device update by just exchanging her sim card from the old device since I purchased a phone ready to be used with TMobile as the carrier. I will update the review if anything comes up. So far, no regrets! Update of almost a year: Phone is doing great! My Mom is learning to use Apple IOS  smoothly and loves her phone! :) Happy daughter here!"
848,It’s a all good phone it’s what I expected but the battery health was at 82% but it was expected
849,Hi real person not a scammy bot here. I bought this iphone xr reowned in coral. The phone arrived a day early. The packaging was cheap but did the job. The phone looks like new and came unlocked ready to go. The only issue i ran into was that my sim card does not seem to want to work with this phone. Im going to contact my cell provider and figure it out. Overall worth the money.
850,Amazing phone one tiny problem is the camer edge is a little scratched
851,nice phone. looks new but didn't come with the screen protector like all other reviews mentioned so i had to go hunt for one and the battery percent was at 95% instead of the 100% from what ive seen some people get which is why i knocked off a star. so far so good it works fine but ive only recently activated it and had it for 1 evening. will update this review more once i use it for a while longer. i messaged the seller to cancel it and even contacted azamon to cancel but it still got sent anyway and im glad since im liking the phone.
852,"I received my phone about a month ago. I was pleasantly surprised when the phone arrived. It came exactly as described; full battery, screen was perfect with no scratches or cracks, and it has held its charge well. There were no scratches or dings on the case of the phone. It was in perfect condition. It was very easy to transfer my info from my iPhone 6. I use StraightTalk for cell service and I did need to call them for help in transferring my number to the new phone. That too was an easy call and within 10 minutes, the phone was ready to use. I have had no issues with any apps or data useage. It's a good phone from great sellers."
853,The battery health was 100% and I still see no problems with this device worth the price for sure
854,"As mentioned, phone arrived promptly and looked perfect.  Everything was fine, except there was a problem with the phone speaker.  I could only hear when the speaker was on and so had to take it to Apple for them to repair it."
855,Bought the iPhone XR and it is in perfect condition. Just like brand new. No scratches or marks on it. Battery life is 100%. Easy to setup and transfer things over from another phone. Works with Straight Talk Wireless. Definitely would recommend!
856,"Had to order 5 of these iPhones and only one was successfully activated to use it with Sprint.Tried to BYOD, checked IMEI and got a message: Sorry, but our records show you still owe Sprint for this phone. I'm a Sprint customer for many years (T-Mobile now), but they're unable to help at a store.We've been able to activate the iPhone came from the seller JetWirelessUSA."
857,"Can’t complain, good price and packaging! Arrived in new condition."
858,"I am very happy with my purchase!! Great phone, great price. All expectations were met."
859,"Like everyone else, I was apprehensive buying such an expensive phone with no guarantee if it will work or not. But it came 2 days after ordering, I will say packing was great. Phone was nicely packaged in a plastic wrap, on first sight I thought it was a new phone. I inspected the hell out it. It’s in absolutely pristine condition. Absolutely no marks on this phone. It’s beautiful. I was a little worried when I turned it on to set it up and update iOS. It had stated it would take 7 hours but it actually took maybe 2 hours (a little less).  Battery is great at 100%. So far I have no complaints about this phone. I’m giving it 4 stars just because I just got it.  The description of the phone and it’s components are exactly what I got. No more no less. I’m happy!!!!"
860,i got the renewed premium and i couldnt be happier! it looks band new and works well!! i would totally recommend :D
861,"I love the phone , it’s is refurbished, and came with after market plugs ( Black not apple white ) and only charged the phone to 80 percent, I replaced the plug with an Apple white and it now charges to 100 percent , would have loved some written instructions , even an easy access address to find answers to easy questions would have helped , face recognition never seem to set for me ... I’ll try again later"
862,"Was a little sceptical at first because all the negative reviews but it Came In perfect condition except the top speaker, it looks a little rusted and barely any sound comes out of it. Other then that is works really good, no scratches or cracks on the screen."
863,"Perfect condition, brand new, thank you sm. Crazy how good it is for cheap"
864,"El producto llego perfecto, igual a nuevo y batería al 99%."
865,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Perfect condition, no screen scratches , battery life good, fast delivery ( I bought Mon arrived Fri), so 5 stars! Thank you guys !"
866,Nothing I don’t like!! Love it!! And excellent price!!
867,The phone was unlocked. The battery life is great. Face recognition is a 4 stat because it doesn't work and has to be done a 2nd time. Very satisfied with this phone
868,"I bought my IPhone XR from Digital Age USA. The phone was in perfect condition when I received it.It was not in the original box, but that was expected. The package it arrived in was very secure.Battery health : 100%Face ID: FlawlessScreen’s Condition: Flawless  | Screen protector includedBody’s Condition: FlawlessColor Purchased: Black"
869,This phone came in even better condition than was listed! It looked brand new. It came very well packaged to protect the phone during shipment processes. I would definitely buy from eLgeo again!!
870,This is a beautiful iPhone however I had some issues with mine periodically it would freeze up and I even had problems with the rotation at one point it took 10 minutes till I was able to get it upright. I even had a few texts messages ithat it wasn’t delivered. But I read some great reviews before I purchased it and I would agree that this phone is a great value and if I haven’t mentioned it’s absolutely gorgeous I would absolutely recommend this phone and the seller they reached out to me right away. Because of my issues is the only reason I give this review a 4 stars. I would recommend that if you purchase this phone make sure that you purchase a case and a screen protector because you don’t want to lose your investment it’s just that beautiful. I truly love this phone and I’m sure you will too. You can buy everything on Amazon so go for it and don’t hesitate.
871,"I got it as a Christmas gift for my wife, AT&T was a nite mare cause we never got credit for our trade ins, l was supposed to get $800.00 then agents to me $700.00 and $350.00 for wife’s phone after 8 months haven’t Any credits yet, 8 months has passed if I miss 8 payments is AT&T going to tell me it’s ok. I have called every month for the last 8 months and nothing yet, guess that’s why AT&T is a billion dollar company and really don’t care for its customers l know you are going to throw this message away cause that’s how AT&T works"
872,Buy yours if you’re in the market!
873,"Phone arrived early, already had latest software updates, and looks like its brand new! Works great!"
874,Works well so far. Battery not 100% percent but no biggie.
875,For this being a refurbished phone it is amazing for what I payed for it it’s a almost 5 year old phone and it still runs great the battery last all day
876,"My girlfriends phone crapped out on her so I ordered her this one. I was skeptical about ordering a renewed phone, but pulled the trigger and ordered it anyway. Less than 48 hours after I ordered it the phone was in hand and it literally looks and functions like it's brand new!!!"
877,"I have a job where I could be on the phone for quite some time. I have to refresh websites constantly and my Androids were not cutting it. I never had an iphone until now and I wish I wasn't so stubborn. I spent so much on androids that would start glitching a year or so later. When I could have just gotten an iphone. I can see if you casually use your phone, but if you are a heavy user, or need for work, SO worth the switch.I bought my husband this phone, from the same seller a few months ago, and it is still working GREAT. He said it's the best phone he has ever had. (he was always an iphone person) I bought mine a month ago and I could kick myself for not making the switch sooner. Life is SO MUCH EASIER. Seller is awesome, highly recommend,."
878,The phone was delivered on time and has worked well. It’s been a little over 2 months since my purchase. Would recommend.
879,"Reading the reviews, I was a little nervous ordering it especially since it was my first time buying my own phone. It came earlier than expected (yay!) and came in pretty good quality. It came with a third party charging block, an apple cord, and the actual phone. The phone did have more cosmetic blemishes than expected including a scratch/crack on the left side of the screen that you can see even from an arm’s length away and very small chips. Considering the price or the phone compared to buying brand new, I’d say that’s pretty reasonable. Other than that, the phone is great! Battery health was at 95% and still lasts the entire day, camera was great, I had no problem putting in my sim card.  Other than the scratch, very satisfied with my purchase."
880,Phone came in perfect condition.Was skeptical at first but nothing was wrong with the phone.would definitely recommend!!!
881,"The phone itself has  issues.  You can’t type if it’s laying down, it’s hard to take pictures because you have to hold the phone a specific way to push the photo button."
882,"It is not a perfect headband, but it has good features that differentiate it from other brands.  for quality and price is the best option"
883,"Es usado, por lo que llegó con algunas marcas se uso. Pero en general estuvo bien."
884,"I was worried at first…but, This is my third purchase from Hybrid IT and I can’t be more than grateful for their talents. I’ve had iPhones from Apple directly that underperformed in comparison with my renewed purchases from them. I highly recommend them. You won’t be disappointed in their product or unbeatable customer support. Thank you Hybrid IT!"
885,came on time nd i had no problems witht he phone. the faial recognization could be better but other than That i love the phone. super happy with this
886,Haven’t utilized the phone yet. Need to finish setting up. Appears to be in good condition.
887,didn’t face any problems so far. Came in Amazon box. Was easy to setup.
888,The quality of the Camera is lovely
889,best device for $300
890,"I was very skeptical on ordering this phone but it came in today and looks literally like new ! I didn't even much see a scratch on the phone. It came in a different box of course, but can't really complain too much there. It also came with a charger. Everything works good so far !"
891,"Quick delivery, exactly what I expected. I’m satisfied."
892,Good apple phone. Using it now to write this. Decent price.
893,this has twice the storage of my old phone just leaning how to fined my way around
894,"Came perfect condition! So happy ! I was so skeptical! I got the yellow one, Verizon  Thank you so much !"
895,"The IPHONE XR that I ordered was provided to me by Hybrid IT.  There was an issue with the original order.  Those things happen, but why I give Hybrid IT 5 Stars is the prompt and immediate plan they developed to remedy the issue.  Everything that I was told that would happen did happen.  My e-mails were answered immediately and there was full accountability.  Companies are comprised of people, and people are occasionally going to make a mistake.  The mark of an excellent company is one that recognizes the issue, apologizes and takes step to immediately correct.  I will have no hesitation in ordering from Hybrid IT the next time I need an IPHONE."
896,I had to keep the battery at a 4-star rating because it's not at its peak since it is a used phone but it's still enough to last me the whole day even after playing Pokemon GO. Love the camera and it fits in my gimbal even with a case on so this is really great for amateur photo/videography.
897,This phone is awful and is a scam
898,There was no a sim card holder in the phone so I had to purchase one separately ... what a bommer
899,"Arrived 2 days early, and works like the brand new iPhone 11 I had gotten from AT&T. This is my second time ordered a renewed XR from Amazon, my first one I would still have had I not traded for an 11 to gift a friend’s child. 10/10 recommend"
900,Dont look at the bad reviews guys im telling yall this phone is good i promise and im not a robot i bought the phone because i have never had an iphone and im not impressed with the battery capacity life it was at 90% but its not terrible and i can work with it besides that everything else is perfect ive downloaded all my apps and stuff on it and im going to transfer it to the plan that im on once i get paid again i give it a 98 out of 100 if the battery life was a little higher i would rate it higher but everything is working great and im satisfied with my purchase thank you
901,"Lo compre para mi familia en Mexico, y no tuvimos ningún problema en conectarlo,"
902,The phone came exactly as stated in description and
903,"The phone I had bought was the IPhone XR red, looks amazing even came with a screen protector already on the phone, a charger and charging box. Battery seems to take a while to charge, sound works along with mic. Pretty good for a renewed phone."
904,So far phone works great as expected. I like having face recognition instead of finger print to login
905,"As far as the shipping, packaging, etc. very good.The reason for low ratings is due to changes Apple has made to their phones more recently (including the XR).I should state before making my points that I like clear,  easily used technology, and am a little old fashioned. Never the less, here are the reasons I am unhappy with the phone.1. No home button. It makes navigating rather difficult - especially quick navigation. I had to completely relearn how to do everything on the phone which I wouldn’t have figured out if my brother (who has the same phone) hadn’t shown me.2. Changing some home button features to a side button - like siri, which I had to deactivate because I kept setting her off.3. They “enlarged” the screen by extending it up around the camera. I am constantly accidentally activating the functions they attached to those areas. Just picking up the phone I have to actually pick it up by the camera most times so I don’t waste time getting into a menu I don’t want and have to get back out of.4. Because everything is operated by swipes, often times I swipe a little one direction and instantly have things on screen I never intended to get into. Rather frustrating. Seems more sensitive than the 6S was.5. Battery life is decent. Not amazing. I have to charge it every night, which in my opinion a modern phone should last longer than one day, but it is what it is.In conclusion, if someone just needs a phone upgrade, sure, grab a XR. If anything I’ve mentioned sounds annoying, maybe look for something else."
906,"I was very pleased with the phone. Being my daughters first cell phone,  I wanted the best bang for the buck & I got it. She was extremely happy & excited to receive it."
907,"As a android user for many years some of the features were not what I was accustom to, but once I learned how to use the phone I really liked it. Don't care for the facial recognition. But all in all know problems I really like the phone."
908,There were scratches on the front of the screen and the battery life is just at what is is acceptable to resell. Did not get a “new” phone like most claimed.
909,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Good
910,the phone was delivered before the date due. The phone works great and is unlocked which is a plus. the phone was in perfect condition and came with all accessories.
911,"It came with a little more marks than I expected, but it was still a great purchase."
912,Phone came in perfect condition and works perfectly.
913,"This phone is a great deal for the price. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars was because it had a few scuffs and scraps around the sides. I don’t mind them so long as it doesn’t effect the phones quality or efficiency. The battery life could be a little better, but I don’t know if that’s Apple’s fault or the seller. Either way that doesn’t deter me either. I will be purchasing from this seller again in the future if they continue such great quality products.I will update this post in a few months to let everyone know the life of this phone as well. I plan on keeping this phone as long as it lasts (which will hopefully be up to 2 years)"
914,"Bought for Christmas 2021 gift.  Very well received and she’s using it daily, ( teenager thing ).Thanks so much for a great phone, great shipping and packaging!  Is like brand new, would not have even thought was refurbished phone!"
915,No scratches nor screen issues. No problems and a long lasting battery life
916,I ordered two phones one of the speakers stopped working and they do not offer exchange just return. So if I return i lose all my stored information unless I get a back up phone right away. I am very unhappy with the service and product.
917,"Have to admit I was VERY skeptical when ordering this phone an it being renewed and it being my first time buying one online. When it came in and I opened the box I could not believe the QUALITY of the phone, it was in PERFECT CONDITION!I mean EVERYTHING LOOKED & WORKS AWESOME. The look of the phone itself was great, the screen quality is amazing and the face recognition works perfectly. I was hoping the battery life was what it said it would be which was around 86% BUT to my surprise it was even better, a whopping 99% 😁.  I couldn’t be happier with my purchase it was literally like buying a BRAND NEW PHONE, I would definitely recommend to anyone!!"
918,Everything works perfectly fine
919,The phone came quickly I suggest ordering a case at the same time but I have had no problems with this phone. Exactly what I was looking for.
920,"Just what I needed for my teenager, she wanted a Newer IPhone 📱 almost 1,000$ which no way in H*! I was going to spend that money...So I looked on Amazon and came across this iPhone XR, read the reviews, thought about it for a little and decided to give it a try, the one part that convinced me was the price and most importantly that the purchase was backed up with Amazon Purchase and Returns so received it yesterday, fully unlocked, no scratches or dents, screen was in perfect shape. Came with the charger and it was just like any brand new purchased phone.I had a previous SIM card, called Metro by TMobile and Transferred alTransferredl the info to the new IPhone and Vuala, i Gad a fully working iPhone for less than 500$ (My goal) and didn’t even needed to go to the store to activate.So, overall on my personal opinion with no benefits or paying me for review, this was a GREAT purchase!"
921,great cellphone
922,"I didn’t even get the premium refurbished and it came with 96% battery life. Screen was flawless, not even a scratch. The XR is the best value iPhone in my opinion so I’m happy that I got it in such a good condition and at such a reasonable price!"
923,It’s a great phone overall only thing I found annoying was having to get use to the navigation bar at the bottom after being use to a button all these years 😂 other than that it is completely as advertised and I do recommend if you are one of those ppl looking through the reviews to see if it’s worth it !
924,Only issue I’ve had with this ph since I got it back in June is the battery life. Other than that it functions very well
925,"I’ll admit after reading through the reviews I was VERY hesitant but I am BEYOND happy with my purchase.The phone is FLAWLESS. Yes you read that right, absolutely flawless. It came with a glass screen protector already installed and all OEM accessories. Phone has a BRAND NEW 100% capacity battery and is still under factory warranty until May 2020. I understand some of this will vary but this is a review of my experience.I purchased another “renewed” phone, Pixel 2XL, from a different seller and it’s perfectly functional but no where near the condition this iPhone XR arrived in.I just popped my SIM card in and it worked right away. Usually with my carrier I have to call in with the imei number but I didn’t have to. I also tried a GSM SIM card and it worked too, fully unlocked as advertised.Best. Used. Phone. Purchase. Ever.So glad I did not listen to all the negative reviews!"
926,I’ve heard so much about I phone. I’ve been a life long Samsung Galaxy user. I know that I phone is simple to operate but totally backwards from what I’m use too. I made the switch for better security. I did purchase an I phone XR which I’m told seems to be there budget phone. My $99. 00 Samsung has a better crisper picture and seems to take pictures just as well. I’ve only owned the I phone 3 weeks and admit I haven’t totally figured it out yet but I have enjoyed it thus far. I’m still partial to my Samsung tho.
927,El producto funciona perfecto y llegó en excelentes condiciones. Parece que no se le han hecho reparaciones pues da toda sensación de tener la bateria y pantalla originales. Llegó con 89% de vida útil de batería y minimos detalles estéticos que francamente no me importan.
928,"Phone works and looks great! Seller however sent a wrong carrier and prompted a return which took about a week longer than I would have liked. Thanks for the speedy, one-day shipping on return though."
929,"Took the leap and ordered the blue XR mode as my first jump into Apple since the old school iPod touch 4th gen. Having had Android for the better part of 10 years, I wasn’t sure if I’d end up returning this phone or notHappy to report that I’m blown away. Phone arrived in a standard brown shopping box with a charger and the phone in bubble wrap. Not a scratch or ding on it. You would think it was new. Battery health of 87% which I don’t think is bad.Everything has worked perfectly. Face ID is blazing fast. iOS is super smooth. Holds up coming from a 90hz display from a OnePlus 7t. Would buy from Amazon renewed again."
930,It looked and worked good except for the volume buttons the volume up button works fine but to turn volume down the button does not work at all and sometimes the power button won’t work either
931,"I love it !! I was so scared to purchase this phone , because I thought it would come broken or scratch up really bad or a fake phone in a box but it didn’t. I crossed my fingers & opened it & I was so happy , because it had no scratches , or any cracks at all. just like a new phone! 😍 everything is good and it is fully unlocked. But one thing i don’t like is the battery life :( kinda dies fast when its on 100% all of a sudden it goes down when I don’t use it at all 😕 but it is a good phone y’all :)"
932,really great phone bought this for my son and he loved it. no issues. it has some light scratches near the camera but it doesn't affect it. unboxing was still satisfying. recommend for another year
933,"Everything works, looks and works brand new seller communicates with you I recommend"
934,"Let’s start by saying I’m coming from a 6s. Ok! So the quality is waaaayyy better in every aspect of the phone!! Then I felt so much more comfortable with this coming from Amazon! Like Amazon… not a vendor thru Amazon. Even though I was ok with buying from a vendor, I just felt better with this longer warranty and I know that Amazon takes responsibility for defects quick!Battery has been great! Camera, great! I’ve had it for a few weeks and no problem thus far! So I say, go for it!! The price is good! The phone is good!! Looked brand new to me! Annndd!!! It was wonderfully packaged! Thank you Amazon!"
935,at first i was sceptical but this phone is amazing 10/10 buy it i promise its worth it
936,I purchased two of these. One for my daughter and one for myself. My daughters came first. That one had some minor scratches that weren’t too much noticeable. But phone worked perfect and she loves it. I ordered mine after seeing how good the first went. Mine was in terrific condition with even less scratches than the first. Both phones were super easy to set up. Expecting I’d have some issues with it being unlocked and the phones activating. But both were as easy as putting in the sim and that was that. Only issue I had with mine was that the battery health was already at 87% which I was assuming would at least be over 90%. Not a biggy though. Both phones shipped super fast and I am very pleased with both of them.
937,"Came in an excellent condition. No scratches of any visible signs of use. Battery health was 96% but after a couple of days it dropped to 93%. Anyway it’s enough for almost full day of using, from 7 am till 10 pm, without watching or listening too much. There is also a minor issue with the front speaker. It’s a bit quieter than in my iPhone 7. So the sound doesn’t really show its stereo effect as it should. Yet it’s not so disturbing"
938,i got this phone for my daugther ! she loved it so happy
939,This phone be flawless like GD I aint seen something this pop en in a minute. Im a have a snatch it again ayeeee. Just some damage but if you have ocd maybe not for you
940,"Phone works for the most part but has a touchscreen issue that generates letters on another part of the screen from the letters actually being touched, resulting in numerous ""go back and do it again"" issues, the letters get repeated again, etc, etc...very frustrating. The Blue tooth function doesn't work well either. I want to return this phone but it's the only one I have so was looking for a replacement. I called Amazon and after about 30 minutes was connected to Apple. at Apple I was told it was out of warrantee. So I called KISS ELECTRONICS IN NY and was told they don't offer a warranty on items they ship to Amazon, that Amazon should. I was told that the little slip of paper inside the KISS box that said a warrantee was offered for 90 days ""should not have been in there.""Classic runaround. When I used that term, I was told by KISS's customer rep, and I quote ""Yea, well sorry about the runaround but that's the way it works.""I will never buy another product from this vendor again. I hope you don't either."
941,The iPhone was purchased for my grandson who is enjoying it immensely.
942,Planning to order another one
943,"Iphone XR in red - i was skeptical at first because of some of the reviews, but mine came perfect! Phone works great, looks and acts brand new, came with a free screen protector and really nice case too! 10/10 would recommend, definitely saved a ton of money getting this."
944,"As of right now very satisfied with this phone. It came with a charging cable and block, but the phone is working great. I was SUPER skeptical at first. Seeing all the negative reviews, about stolen phones and locked phones. But those really negative reviews were a couple years old, so I kept a positive outlook. The phone is quick and much better than my iPhone 7 which served me very well for its time and age, and overall this phone is in mint condition. It has a couple of surface scratches on the screen but nothing major. As for its battery life I was kinda disappointed with it being barely at 89% but other than that a great phone. Approved by me. Hope this sits well with anyone attempting to pull the trigger on this phone."
945,My husband is always leery of refurbished items bit even he was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this phone.
946,"Phone came in new condition. No scratches or marks. I have had t for a month now and have had no issues. Shipped and arrived super fast. I was nervous buying a renewed phone, but so far I am very happy with purchase"
947,"I can barely hear anyone while talking on the phone unless I put it on speaker. I just got the phone today . Speaker quality is horrible. Even with the volume all the way up, you can barely hear the person. I had to thoroughly clean the top speaker and once I did, it worked fine. The item itself was in very good condition. The back color wasn’t worn off in places and screen looked perfect. Only issue I truly had was the speaker. As a renewed item, they should have tested it prior to selling it."
948,Screen was scuffed
949,Got this for my grandson & he loves it.  Had some very very minor scratches on the case barely able to see. Good screen no scratches there. He's 16 yes old so if he's happy with it then so am i
950,I like the battery life and the screen quality is clean.
951,So far been a good phone. Android user switched over to iPhone. Seems like a good phone for first time iPhone User. No complaints yet
952,I thought they were going to work with me at first!!  But then guess I was wrong! I thought wow what a good company but then they won’t work with me!! Phone glitches!! Only phone I have can’t be without and with my phone company have to have the old phone to get a code to set up the phone!! But no they won’t work with me!! I mean at least offer a partial payment back because 400$ for a phone that glitches is crazy!!!! Do better company do better!!! I am a honest person made to feel like I’d do wrong!! I wouldn’t want to be charged twice so yes I’d send this one back with no issues!! That’s a big chunk to be charged twice!! Only giving a 3 star because I don’t hate the phone don’t like the service I was given! But do give them credit that when I sent it back they gave me myMoney back!! But worked out because with just little extra cash I got a iPhone 11.
953,"Changed from non-supported iPhone 6 plus to iPhone XR. Order arrived within a couple days. Very good condition and functions better than old phone. Battery only dropped 5% in half a day. Pairs with Apple watch series 5 with no problem. Happy customer, Thanks!"
954,Difficult to set up for the elderly. Need help someone tech savy
955,"I had a first generation XR a few years ago, this 2nd gen is even better. Battery life is good, and the screen is the perfect size for gaming."
956,"My issue was the screen it looked new but it wasn’t working too well, when scroll or typing it feels I’m piercing my fingers through the phone for it to respond. I’ve changed the screen and it’s brand new"
957,"For a used, pre owned, renewed phone this is 5 star. You can’t expect a brand new phone when buying renewed. A few scratches (light scratches, not deep) on the top right of the screen and that’s it. Completely functional. Seems flawless."
958,I purchased 2 one for each of my sons. These are in perfect condition and such a great deal!
959,My kids is happy
960,The iPhone speaker is already busted and we could not get it to charge until we wiggled the charging cord so it’s already worn out I would not recommend it would not buy
961,I'm so happy my iPhone XR came in a good condition and I didn't receive any problems.
962,I had to get it replaced. The first one I ordered didn’t work. You couldn’t charge it. I reached out to customer service and they were very helpful and replaced it. I am glad they did because the first one was a little worn looking as well. May have been just a dud. The replacement looked like new and has worked great. The replacement did take longer than I wanted to arrive but it wasn’t such a big deal. This is a good alternative to buying new the price point worked great for us. I’d definitely buy again if I needed to.
963,El telefono esta super en buen estado
964,First I was scared to order a phone off Amazon but this IPhone XR 128Gb is amazing! I’ll order it all over again.
965,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Battery lasts two days for me without a charge. No minor scratches it really looks new. Was able to connect to my carrier with no issues.
966,"I got my phone today, and was extremely relieved and satisfied. The phone came intact with a generic iphone charger and block which was fine with me. It also transferred everything from my old iphone to this one within 20 minutes which was very convenient. The phone has a clean, nice condition screen and back, and the cameras checked out fine. I don't know if I missed this part in the description but it also came with a case for the phone, and it is of good quality. I was the most excited about the battery health, which the settings told me the phone had a 94% battery life! I was worried when the description of this phone said it would have at least 80% battery life, but overall I could not have been more satisfied!"
967,"The iPhone worked perfectly, and looked good… until… six months later, when the screen protector had done its job well and needed to be replaced, I found that the actual screen was very scratched up and this  had been hidden by the type of adhesive used on the screen protector it came with. Great job hiding the damage they didn’t want to repair, but poor job selling a damaged phone as “reconditioned” when all they did was hide scratches with a cheap trick."
968,The phone is great and it’s at a good price 9/10 quality😊
969,"Excelente, vendedor recomendable"
970,So relieved that this unlocked phone is working perfectly here in South Africa. Looks virtually brand new say for 2 tiny marks near the charging port. Battery health is 89% and screen scratch-free. Absolutely no issues setting it up. Love the 90 day peace of mind return policy.
971,"Phone seems like new, working well EXCEPT when I call out, sometimes cannot be heard.  Phone or service?? Checking it out"
972,I ordered this phone for my daughter she had an iphone 7 which we ordered from amazon a few years ago and had no problems worth.Pros:excellent condition no scratchesscreen looks like neweasy to set upcame with chargerhad screen protector on when we got itCons:one of the speakers does not workbattery life is only at 94%Overall great purchase she has airpods she uses most of the time and a blue tooth speaker but it would be nice if it was inspected to ensure everything was functioning before it was sent out.
973,"Honestly this phone was a fantastic purchase. The Bluetooth works, the battery life I got was 89%, very very minimal signs of usage. I MADE SURE to buy my phone from Hybrid IT specifically. I highly suggest you specify who you want to buy this phone from instead of just hitting the purchase button. But, so far- I’m very happy.One thing you might need to know is that when you first receive the phone, it will need to be updated manually. This took my phone about 30 minutes to do. Some people it takes longer. (Some up to 3 hours). Make sure you watch the progress bar and don’t force restart or you’ll brick your phone."
974,So the phone was in excellent condition and the face recognition immediately took and the screen quality the only thing is for some reason I can’t access the App Store but I just got the phone yesterday but I’ll contact the company
975,"Product arrived with the speaker system completely useless. Using it to listen to messages, speaking with someone, using it for face time or playing music was impossible due to static and flawed sound reproduction. First time I ever purchased a refurbished model that wasn’t up to spec. Sorely disappointed."
976,"At first I was surprised to see such a nice phone. I could deal with a few light scratches on the screen. But when I saw that the battery life was 89 I was eager to send it back. I the  reas  thru the fine print and they admit to selling you a phone with above 80 percent life which is to be like new .. I will give this a a few days test and see what's up, altogether it was a quick shipment and I am surprised."
977,I got the phone and it had a small knick in it which wasn’t a big deal but then I noticed the top of my screen was starting to come off. After taking my case off I noticed there was glue coming out of the edges of the phone.
978,Battery is absolute crap. Discharges way too fast for a “renewed” phone… so either they didn’t replace the battery or these phones come standard with spyware causing the battery to discharge at an existential rate.
979,"Looks new, works like new, not a total fan of the color but it’s not hatefully orange. Overall grateful for an affordable, functional temporary replacement for my broken phone."
980,Perfect!
981,Good
982,"I ordered this phone on March 31 and it arrived the next day, on April 1st. When I opened the package I was excited to see that the phone looked brand new. Upon setting it up and checking the battery health I noticed it had 89% which I was upset about at first because I saw reviews talking about how their phones came with 100% battery health and I was hoping I would get one too. It has now been 4 days since I got this phone and the battery health is at 86%?? I get that it is still above 80% but the battery health dropped 3% in just 4 days. I don’t think that’s very normal and I feel like my phone is always getting so low on percentage so fast. This is my main concern, everything else like the screen and just the exterior of the phone is fine."
983,I love this iPhone other than the battery came at 93% but that's no problem because it said it was a guaranty to have at least 80%. the other thing is that it freezes up once you use it to much and it gets hot but all it needs is a break then it takes of working again in about 10 min. those are the only things that i can point out in this phone because other than those this is a great quality iPhone.
984,"Phone came in amazing, no issues whatsoever, perfect looking/sounding phone."
985,This phone came in clutch. I experienced no technical difficulties with my phone for the past to weeks! The seller is really trustworthy and this my 2nd phone I have bought from him(1st one was stolen and had no issues as well) and I  will only continue to buy from this seller.
986,"Received this phone March 15,2022 with a generic charger. Visible scratches to the front screen, added a screen protector didn’t help much. Back camera severely scratched up as well, battery life 87%. Everything else seems to be working just fine will provide another update later."
987,"Es igual al original la única diferencia es la caja, y el precio es increíblemente mejor"
988,"Phone arrived in excellent condition, almost new. Battery capacity came at 83%. This is the first time buying a phone off of amazon and I'm impressed."
989,"I got this phone a couple days ago, and it has been outstanding! Looks and works like new, no scratches, smudges or anything! The performance is amazing, no lagging and is very quick. Face ID works perfectly. The screen looks amazing and gets very bright if your interested in that. The battery life is one of the best I’ve ever seen. I am a heavy user of my phone and at the end of the day I still have 20% left. My maximum capacity of my battery life 100%!! I still can’t believe that with a renewed iPhone! I am very happy with this purchase. No regrets! Go for It!"
990,"I like that the phone came really well packaged. It did not have a scratch on it. It  powered up just fine easy setup with my Apple account.But unfortunately the earpiece speaker did not work. I was so disappointed, I did just love the phone except for thatGot in touch with the seller and they agreed to take it back with no problems.It took a few days for it to get returned and get my $ back for that was okay. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again."
991,"At the beginning, the screen was perfectly normal and no damage could be seen from the outside. Because I broke the screen protecter at the corner with the key, I decided to replace the screen protecter , then I found that the screen was broken. Not big deal"
992,I was scared to order this phone but I took a chance and when I received it it came with the box and cable and there were no scratches on the phone camera quality is so good the face recognition works and my battery life goes all the way up to 100% so I’m really happy about that. And I ordered this like two days before it came in it was a post to come into like another week so it came really fast and I was skeptical at first about it but when I got the phone It was like it was brand new I highly recommended you buy it
993,It works well no issues at all so far
994,I like that I was just as described
995,The phone was packaged well and the switch over was easy.
996,"I bought a renewed premium phone and when I received it, the phone's battery was at 88% which they guaranteed to be at 90%+. A few days after using it, I noticed that there was a small strip on the left side of my screen that was unresponsive. Contacted support and the most they can do is issue me a 25% refund for my phone and I keep it and spend over $150 on screen repair. I'm not really bothered by the battery percentage but I would have loved to have had a perfectly working phone without having to go through the hassle of going to a local repair shop in order to have my phone working in perfect order as Amazon said that my phone would be in."
997,I bought this refurbished iPhone for my son. It came with a full charging cord and exactly as described. I would not hesitate to purchase another refurbished phone from this company.
998,10/10
999,Lovvvvveee love love
1000,"Excelente,  buen producto"
1001,"I searched through the reviews  after I already pulled the trigger. I was going to cancel my order because of the negative reviews.  My phone arrived 4 days early. in excellent condition.  I had one problem with getting it to update, it took 2 hours. It sat and spun and finally it downloaded.  So far so great, I love this phone.  If  I have any trouble I can send it back in 90 days, but it seems solid!UPDATE 3/27 The phones still working great and  recently had a software update  which went perfectly without any problem. Whew!  My phone was sold and shipped by Digital Age USA if anyone was wondering."
1002,"I was really worried about spending this much money on a phone, bought online, sight unseen. But between the return policy and the guarantees I figured I'd try. I'm glad I did, it made a perfect Christmas gift for my son. Thank you! I just may buy my next upgrade the same way."
1003,I received the phone without incident and as expected. Thank you!
1004,"Works perfectly! Good deal!It came in neutral packaging, with third-party charger, lightning cable, and a screen protector.It didn't come with headsets."
1005,I really like me
1006,It is in great shape and it works good and I love it and it’s not cracked or anything
1007,No problems with the phone it came right on time
1008,"Just wanted to share my experience buy the used iPhone XR off of amazon. As for the body and screen of the phone, the screen and back are absolutely fantastic and the only noticeable damage is two tiny nicks on the aluminum side which I have to look really hard to see. The battery health is at 96%. So I’m really happy, I did read some mixed reviews but I’m sure it depends on the seller you get it from. It did come with an off brand charger and no headphones but it did come with a decent clear case with no brand which is nice because I didn’t order a case I wanted to go in a store or try out a few first and this will keep it safe until then. The seller was chubbiestech as well so just wanted to let you guys know that. Super happy."
1009,"Phone came as described in good conditions no scratches or anything on the device, came with a lightning cable, generic wall charger and a screen protector.  The packaging was good but FedEx didn't take care of it, when I came home I saw my package open and I thought someone had stolen.  Good thing everything was there, I do not blame the seller for this. My device came with 89% of maximum capacity and it last me through my whole day, I do light browsing, check my emails, watch videos and play some games for a short amount of time. Overall good experience so far."
1010,The battery inside the phone was at 87 and not new
1011,Satisfied with iPhone XR..Just like new!!
1012,I got the black one. The packaging I got it in was protective. Came with a charger as well and it works fine but I don’t need it. Not a single scratch was on the phone since i received it. The response on the screen is perfect too and so is the battery life. The camera quality is cool as well. MOTS just order it.
1013,"I’ve bought iPhones new ever since 2006 when I bought the very first model. I’ve never ever considered refurbished especially for a phone, but I decided to take a risk. Mainly because I REALLY wanted the XR in blue in 256gb and Apple stopped offering this model (to entice you towards the more recent models). I wanted to get the best XR I could because it’s the last LCD display by Apple w the best battery. I want this phone to last 3-5 years. I spent $580 after tax, and I got what cost $1000 about a year and a half ago. There’s not a single scratch on my phone, the battery life came with 100% health! It honestly feels like someone owned this phone for less than a week, and gave it back and it was “refurbished”. Very impressed, can’t believe I got a brand new battery. Chubbiestech was my seller"
1014,"The best refurbished phone I have bought! Super happy with the condition of the battery life and screen quality, no scratches!"
1015,"I just about didn't get this because I was so scared it wouldn't work, or be broken when i got here, or some other reasons.... But to be honest, this is the best purchase I have made. I am not being paid to say this either; This phone was just like a brand new one. I got it for my son after he busted his other one he had. The price was also lower than what everyone else was selling theirs for, which was also a big plus! We have had not one issue with the phone since we got it. I will be doing future business with this company again!"
1016,Phone came faster then what it was supposed too come !! Very such good quality. !!
1017,"The camera on this phone is horrible, my iphone x has a better camera than this phone and now i have to come out of MY money to get it fixed.. im 15 with no job."
1018,its a great phone it was supposed to be temporary but might as well keep it it works great camera is good charger is also good and arrived in 3 days
1019,"The quality of the screen is great. I was also impressed by the health of the battery of 90%, really good for a renewed phone, I only found a barely visible scratch at the bottom of the screen, you have to pay close attention to even notice it. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
1020,I bought it for my granddaughter an she has had no problems she actually loves it an thats saying a lot for her since she has been through many phones an tablets
1021,Love it
1022,I love this phone! It is a great phone at a price.
1023,"First photo taken with my ""new"" iphone. I love it. Finally, I feel like a modern man."
1024,I like the camera and the battery life is great it goes just about a whole day without really being charged
1025,"I didn't take a pic before I got it repaired. The phone we received had been repaired before apparently. Whomever repaired it left a screw under the bottom left corner of the screen. The tech at Best Buy showed me where one corner was slightly bowed up. When I'd tried to put it in a silicone case that we also ordered, I cracked the screen putting barely any pressure on it at all. We took it to Best Buy Geek Squad for a replacement. $200 on a phone we literally got the day before. Technically, I broke it by putting it in the case. However, the extra screw was putting unnatural pressure on the screen making it easier to break. Additionally, the battery came at only 85% life left. Not terrible, but we'll have to replace it within a year or upgrade the phone. Somewhat disappointed."
1026,I was very afraid to buy a phone online from any network. But OMG THIS ONE IS THE BEST! It also came with a charger and phone case. Save me from spending more money.
1027,"La vida útil de la batería está muy buena y la calidad de la pantalla también, todo funciona excepto el botón de volumen"
1028,"For the price I couldn’t be happier with what I got, it has two minor scratches on the edge of the phone which you can’t even see if you use a case, other than that, battery life is at 83%. Would have liked a better battery but like I said with the price I’m happy!"
1029,Just get it
1030,Very long battery life
1031,"I haven't done a product review in years but I couldn't ignore doing this purchase when I have such an excellent product for a decent price. Firstly, this phone is literally like mint condition NOT a scratch whatsoever, it is 100% Unlocked use with my Metro PCS service successfully activated. It also came with a brand new and very long charger and adapter and screen saver already installed on the phone. So far all features on the phone are working and hopefully it remains this way. If someone is hesitant to buy this phone I would reassure that you can give it a try it worth the money almost like new and mainly its function like new as well. I hope this review helps.Update: my phone has been working no issueI'm still enjoying it. Great buy!"
1032,"I was very scared at first to purchase this phone due to bad reviews. However yellow is my favorite color and I actually wanted the iPhone XR for a while. So when I saw the phone I immediately added it to my cart. Anyways the phone was brand spanking new had to be. It had absolutely no scratches, they even provided a phone case with it. No it doesn't come in a apple box nor with headphones but I didn't need them I have airpods. The battery life is great, the charger isn't a Apple charge but its fit for an iPhone. It was fully unlocked like they said. I will definitely be purchasing another one for my son."
1033,"Comes in a large box with setup instructions,  SIM card tool and an ""other"" brand  Lightning power cord and Belkin plug in. The cord quit charging, but my spare cord works fine.  In the photos you can see the box and instructions. The phone, I added a screen protector and a blue case."
1034,"I'm the type of person to get bothered by the littlest things, like a hairline crack. The phone came in and it worked just fine, but there was a tiny crack on the actual screen. One day went by with me trying to ignore it but I couldn't stop looking at it. I'm just going to return it tonight and but an iPhone from Apple."
1035,The phone looks as good as buying straight from manufacturer.  Phone is unlocked and works perfectly.
1036,"Received the phone 2 days after ordering as a replacement for my broken SE, and it arrived in near-perfect condition. One tiny scuff on the side, can barely see it. 98% battery health — 100% satisfied with my purchase, and they even sent a free phone case! Highly recommend"
1037,"I have had this phone now for 24 hours, this is my opinion on it from the time I’ve owned it, I will update if anything comes up.This phone functions 100% perfectly. The screen was in almost perfect condition, a few micro scratches at the top of the front facing camera. The back is a little scuffed up, honestly doesn’t look to be anything more than the previous owners daily use. The battery health was at 94% when I pulled it out of the box. Everything works as it should and there is no slow downs when comparing to my friends brand new iPhone XR he’s had for a week. The True Tone is even still functional. All around a great experience and if you’re not afraid of a few cosmetic blemishes, I would totally recommend picking up this phone from these sellers. I saved $200 and wouldn’t even consider buying this phone new."
1038,"I bought this phone with Amazon renewed premium and it had absolutely no scratches or dents. Looked completely new.  I would recommend buying this renewed phone if only it comes with over 90 battery health, mine came with 91. I was aiming for over 95 but could really care less of now."
1039,"This refurbished iPhone Xr was the best experience I have ever had ordering a refurbished phone. Not only was the battery at 99% health, there were no scratches or visible dents, and it came with a screen protector installed! I came from an OLED screen phone and the iPhone Xr’s display is phenomenal, definitely recommend. The battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy usage, the camera is as good as some brand new 2021 phones! The seller shipped it in hours and I got it the next day! Super satisfied. Though the it did not come with an apple box but that’s not that important to me."
1040,"I was afraid to buy this iPhone because it’s not cheap! & even friends & cell phone companies  were telling I was basically buying this from someone living in their moms basement lol But I got the total opposite!!! I love it, looks & feels BRAND NEW & something I was skeptical about was if it was gonna be unlocked to any carrier & it was! I got a prepaid plan with T-mobile, I wanted to wait a couple weeks to write my review. I Absolutely love it!  Also it came with a Tempered Glass Screen Protector!!! Thanks So much to whom ever sent it to me (sellers)Don’t listen to all these haters that have negative comments I was also comfortable buying it because they offer the 90day “warranty” to return it.Here are some pics I took today No scratches or dents Open to any carrier Everything I wanted <3"
1041,I’m very satisfied with my coral iPhone xr! Came in 3 days earlier then what it was suppose to. No cracks or scratches! Literally looks brand new! Also came with a case and screen protector that I didn’t even know was included!!!
1042,"Just want to share some up to date feedback for those looking. If I am pleasantly surprised by an experience, I feel I owe the company some good feedback. I took a chance and ordered a renewed unlocked white iphone XR phone from this listing. Tech Exchange was the seller who fulfilled the order.-Phone arrived on time in pristine condition. I couldn't find a scratch on it.-It had a glass screen protector already applied. This was a nice bonus.-The ""battery health"" indicator in iOS showed 100%. I was expecting since it was renewed it would be off a couple percentage points.-I've activated the phone with dual sim on verizon and google fi's networks. So no issues with the phone being sim-locked.-The phone has otherwise worked flawlessly. I've had it for about 2 weeks now.I am super happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone on the fence."
1043,I took a chance and ordered this renewd iPhone XR to upgrade my iPhone 6S without breaking my arm. It came in a perfect condition like new. Also with 90 days Amazon guarantee how could I go wrong. I do recommend to look at refurbished iPhones from Amazon before spending a fortune on a new iPhone
1044,"i love this phone so much, but when I received it, my phone came in horrible packaging and it could hav broken. i was disappointed about that but other then that my phones great."
1045,Looks brand new  and  works great.  All I need.
1046,"Refurbished phone purchases in general involve embedded risk (often cosmetic depending on your expectations, and occasionally functional as read from reviews), so return policy is a must to me.  This came  in great condition.  Very happy about it as a Christmas gift for my child."
1047,Bought this refurbished and love it. Came in a plain white box with a charging wire and no AC charger but I have quite a few that work with the lighting wire. This phone's battery is such that I can go all day and still have 50% left on the battery. Still learning some aspects of the i-Phone but it is much more responsive than the cheat Moto 5 plus android model I bought so as to not pay leasing fees. This phone is the most I've ever spent on a phone and still much cheaper than buying new. I even upgraded to 64 GB because I know what happens when the memory starts to go as on the 32 GB I had on the old phone.
1048,"This one is also great, but I got red and my order was black instead."
1049,All good
1050,Good as expect
1051,Great little apple 🍎  battery life is super  love my new  screen
1052,El parlante del dispositivo emite unos sonidos extraños
1053,Great phone so far
1054,"Avant Solutions selling damaged iPhone as i bought it on Jan 8, 2022 and faced touch screen problem after two weeks but restarted worked temporally, so i thought it might be software issue. Just 2 days before return window ends (April 13) started frequently but this time restart couldn't work. I thought to raise a request to return but unfortunately got some emergency and got busy in and missed return window. when i came out from emergency and raised the request on 92nd day. They said that i can't take it back even though i thought I do have Amazon's back but both the seller asked me to connect with Apple care. I contacted and came to know that this phone already have screen history. This phone does have hardware issue. I tried to work with Amazon and seller both but no luck. Amazon suggested to open A-Z Guarantee claim but no luck. Then i realized there is no benefit shopping from Amazon. The seller is still selling damaged products but Amazon didn't take any action not even any warning to seller.I would suggest everyone not to buy any product from third part specially Avant Solutions, it's trap and you will lose your money. I want to give -negative rating to this seller but i am not getting an option."
1055,Phone is in good condition although the battery life is down to 83% it still holds a good charge. Screen is in decent shape with one small defect in lower right corner but you can’t see it with a case on. The back glass is pristine
1056,"I got a great deal with this one. It worked great out of the box and had virtually no cosmetic problems. The back had a slight scratch. For $300, I’d buy from this seller again, no problem."
1057,"This is my second phone bought from this seller, the first phone was for my husband. I gave these phones 3 stars because I literally get no service with this phone and my husband has the exact same issue. I thought switching to an iPhone I would get an overall better usage out of it, but I was wrong. The phone gets no more than two bars ever and I’ve done everything to fix it from resetting it to the APN to calling my network. Finally they let me know it’s the phone. I want to be able to enjoy my phone and what iPhone has to offer but also have my same service. I have a 5G plan and can’t get but one or two bars at a time. I just don’t understand. I would give it less but I do enjoy the emojis and how beautiful the phone is. It came unlocked with no scratches."
1058,"This is the second one that I have purchased in 3 months and it's just as if I walked out of an apple store with a brand new iPhone.... These phones are RENEWED and you'd never be able tell it from a NEW one!!!! They include a free piece of tempered glass that even a  new phone doesn't come with!!! With Fast shipping these helped make a happy birthday for two kiddos, thanks again! As you see I switched up the boxes for the second one it's my son's first phone so wanted him to have the whole experience....."
1059,Fast shiping and phone works great!
1060,The phone is everything I ask for
1061,"Phone came in decent shape, but after a few weeks the ear speaker stopped working and only works on speaker phone. The top part of the screen is starting to blur. Sadly we’ll be sending it back."
1062,"It came so sleek and i couldnt see any physical or interior signs that it was used, it only charges slowly but other than that i am very satisfied with my order!"
1063,"We wanted this model of phone and the price was fair but it is ""refurbished"" and the battery was only 80% and the screen was grazed slightly, nevertheless I would buy it again if necessary and would still recommend a good refurbished phone if the price works for you esspecialy with Amazon's guarantees."
1064,My husband has this phone so knew what I was getting.  Great seller...product as described.  Has worked well for over 6 weeks.
1065,"Compre dos, y están perfectos y funcionan bien en Chile, 4G sin problema."
1066,Very scared my phone was not going to be what I thought it was but I got it a day early it works perfectly no problems at all! The reviews scared me but it had the best rating and many good reviews aswell thanks so much for my phone guys I had cracked my other iPhone and also got it from Amazon in perfect condition it was just time to upgrade so don’t be scared like I was about buying it it’s totally worth it especially since it is refurbished!!!!
1067,i think this is a really good product i ordered it twice and there are not problems that i can see with either of them they also both came early so that’s a plus!
1068,I love my iPhone XR
1069,Waiting for a SIM card….
1070,Okay this phone is great I love it the battery life is amazing it last me all day. It’s kinda wired at first but this seller is awesome it came like 4 days earlier then expected. no cracks or scratches it looks like a brand new iPhone  I recommend this seller 10/10 I will definitely be buying from him or her again if I need a phone :)
1071,I loved this phone I got it is very helpful and it come with a few scratches on the back and a line at the bottom of the phone but other than that it’s very good
1072,Like I said it doesn't really charge well but just get a charging pad and you're all good. Other than that it's a great phone. I'm 15 and it's good for all my pictures and for school.
1073,"Received the Black XR today. Phone looks brand new, no performance issues so far after getting all my accounts and apps loaded. It came with a tempered glass screen too which I really appreciated."
1074,The camera was a little scratched up but the overall quality was good.
1075,I bought this for my daughter because I didn’t want  to buy her a brand new one . This one works great . It was very easy to activate.
1076,"Estéticamente está mal, tiene manchas en el cristal trasero y golpes de caídas en los costados"
1077,It’s ok  Not as good reception as my att xr.  Was hoping the upgrade would be as -good as my att xr but turns out just as bad reception as my 6 plus I wanted to upgrade on t-mobile  Grrr. Oh well.  400 bucks later newer phone same crappy reception and no home button.  Should of just went with the 8 plus instead.  Positive note.  Phone was as good as new.  Fair price.
1078,I’m very satisfied with this phone and I received it with at least 90 battery life.
1079,The iPhone XR is amazing it’s easy to use I had it since October it’s loud I got the 128 gigabytes the storage is amazing but the only problem I seem to have if I’m on FaceTime with somebody for a long time my phone starts to freeze up and do it’s own thing like move on it’s on so the only way how I fix that problem is I gotta turn off the phone and turn it back on but it’s a great phone to use tho DONT be scared to by it
1080,We purchased this phone for our teen almost a year ago after her old iPhone broke. This phone is great! We have had no complaints yet and it is still working properly. We did buy a unicorn beetle case for it which I like a lot more then Otter boxes.
1081,"Pros:1. Battery capacity was 91% when I received it.2. Was completely unlocked, ready to be signed in.3. No lags while using, felt like a brand new phone.Cons:1. There were a few scratch marks on the screen in the upper right corner.Apart from that, the phone felt brand new aesthetically in hand.**If you are on a tight budget but want to have an iPhone, I would highly recommend this iPhone XR. Go for it without any hesitation.**Also, I want to thank the Seller 'Chubbiestech' for the nice packaging and for providing me a much-required screen protector in the box itself."
1082,Had to return one because it wasn’t unlockedAfter a while the battery dies and randomly turns off at like 20%It serves it purpose but it’s cheap
1083,"Presentaba suciedad en las bocinas, que ocasionaba ruidos agudos y una mala experiencia de audio."
1084,Battery came at 87% phone had little scratches on the edges and one small nick on the screen
1085,"I was going back and forth on whether to get the iPhone 11 or the X. I found the Xr and read reviews and most people are satisfied with their Xr. I’m glad I found this refurbished one on here. So far, the phone has worked well. I haven’t had any issues . The camera is magnificent. I am using this phone with Straight Talk, and it took about 8 hours to port over from Verizon. Unless I missed it in the description, I wasn’t aware of who the original carrier of the phone was, so that threw me off because I was trying to get the porting started and it kept tell me the phone was not compatible. Turns out you have to know what carrier the phone is on in order to have the correct porting. Other than that, I am satisfied with my purchase. You can’t beat the price."
1086,"I love this phone. Great camera, great screen, but the battery life can be a lil iffy, at least it doesn’t die at 50 percent like my s8 did!"
1087,I love it. Like brand new!! Get it RN!! Was unlocked and great
1088,Phone came with a charge cord a generic brand. Everything worked fine so far phone charges well and does not have any issues.
1089,"I was really scared about getting a damaged product , I read the reviews everyday until it came.. shipping was fast and the package came 1 day early .. battery was at 84% I was hoping 90 or higher but that’s alright .. for me. I did have some scuffs at the top of the phone tho and near the charging port . the what bands on the Side also look a little dingy . My seller was CHUBBIESTECH.. and they gave me a free screen protector and case."
1090,Phone was in perfect condition.
1091,Me encantó el producto total
1092,"The phone that I got was in okay condition, a few scratches here and there. The only issue I have with it is that it’s really slow on downloading apps, which seemed suspicious, so I benchmarked it and the phone scored 300 points lower than the average iPhone XR. Not only that, but the top speaker didn’t work. I wasn’t expecting much but this really disappointed. Definitely not buying a phone from Amazon again smh."
1093,Battery was too low for the price. It was at 85%
1094,"This is the second phone that I have purchased from Hybrid IT.  I ordered one for my husband a couple of months ago and their customer service was so great when we had an issue with FedEx so I decided to get an updated phone for myself.  Katherine was amazing, explaining the differences in the phones I was considering and the making sure I got the phone ASAP!  AMAZING service!  This phone is great, and I finally do not have to charge my phone after every call or a few minutes on FB so I LOVE IT!  I highly recommend this vendor, Hybrid IT - look them up, you won't regret it!"
1095,"Great purchase! Replaced my old iPhone 6splus. I think I actually got a new iPhone! Seamless transition (thank you Verizon), I could not be more pleased. I love everything about this iPhone XR!"
1096,GOSTEI DE TUDO!!
1097,"i was a little worried after reading a few negative reviews, as far as my experience, i have to say it is fantastic, i could not be more pleased, phone arrived on time and after a very close inspection of the phone, i rate as an A++++++++++. not a mark chip or even a blemish, this is my first used phone purchase, always bought new until they priced me out of the new phone market. i will upgrade this phone in a couple of years and will only buy from the same source, thanks for the great deal, keep up the good work"
1098,"Overall this phone was in perfect quality and am really happy with the condition.  Everything works perfectly.  My only negative is the battery was at 88% health which essentially means I'll need to get a new battery in maybe 6 months or so.  Was really hoping for higher after reading so many good reviews on battery life.  I'll probably return it and just spend the money on a new phone as the price isn't that much more and then I don't have to deal with the hassle of a new battery.  It is totally phone dependent though, bought an Iphone 7 from the same seller at the exact same time, battery at 100% health and works perfectly.  Seller was Hybrid IT."
1099,Loved it
1100,This phone has a great battery life and takes beautiful photos
1101,Only received in two weeks
1102,"I just got my new phone through fedex and it looked perfect! The battery life was at 89 and there were no cracks, scratches or marks on the phone. It came 3 days sooner than it was suppose to an I love it. I’m very happy with my purchase"
1103,Love this phone and it’s price is really good
1104,It wasn’t bad for the price but battery life was diminished by 20% and speakers were blown
1105,Super nice.
1106,"This was the smartest decision I have made since divorcing that woman last year - buying the used iPhone. At a fraction of the cost, I got excellent screen resolution quality, superb picture quality, excellent battery life, and the status upgrade (I had had a flip phone, riser Motorola IV prior to it) I needed to get back to the dating scene in a ripe old age of slightly over 70 (which is the new 40). In short I love this phone. I am on a limited budget so I hack into neighbors WiFi all the time, which this phone does with ease too."
1107,"The refurbished iPhone XR arrived in excellent shape.  Perfect screen condition, no scratches on body, no visual damages at all.  The phone looks brand new.  Battery is at 93%.  The seller even threw in a few screen protection sheets and a protection case.  Very much appreciated!  Just for reference, earlier a competitor sent me a XR at a 10% higher price with a screen in terrible condition (three visible scratches that became even more noticeable when the phone got powered up).  I returned it.  Shipment costs on me ….  Refund has not been issued yet.  So, it is a gamble."
1108,"Very long story but basically the phone broke and when I made the mistake of not using the first label, the whole process went down hill thanks to Amazon supports un-helpful ""help"".  Seller made it right with us even after the time limit to return it had passed.  Bought two phones, other works great.  Very happy with the XR in general also."
1109,"The battery installed is not a genuine apple battery ,the phone works fine but it does not recognize the battery which gives me a cloud of doubt if i bought a knock off iphone which i hope not! I contacted The seller gave me a $70 back as a refund the battery but i can see that they knew about about it prior to my purchase as they dont have a fix for it, they just want me to return the phone ,lesson learned... DONT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES! ESPECIALLY FROM SELLERS THAT THINKS THAT MY CLAIM IS ""NON SENSE TALK"""
1110,Para ser celular renovado es como nuevo !!!
1111,"It took only a few weeks for the phone to mess up and I took care of this phone like it was my child. The phone would glitch out here and there and then shut off randomly after being fully charged and ever now and then when my phone is charging at night I will wake up while it’s on the charger and it’s completely shut down. The phone it’s worth what I expected tho everything else is in good condition just expected more from a billion dollar company. And would like a refund just enough to fix the port even half idc, because I got my carrier on the phone and all my personal info and everything and don’t want to send it back. I have been proud with most of the things I have gotten from Amazon and even the phone but using it in time disappointed me and I’m slowly losing my trust about buying things from them"
1112,"92% battery life when I got it, it’s been a little while and it’s still right there. No scratches or anything on the phone. Works perfect for me"
1113,Great value for the price and works great
1114,This phone is so good the battery life is a 89 but other than that I LOVE IT l. it’s unlock and it is in great condition!!!
1115,"My wife and son were both in the market for a new phone. I wasn’t paying $1500 for the latest and greatest, I just wanted something that I knew worked. Both of the phones came in looking like brand new, but both needed to be updated to the latest iOS. My wife’s phone battery so that max charge was at 96%, my sons phone said max charge was 94%. This is totally acceptable for the price that I paid"
1116,Picture was clear all functions a phone working properly.
1117,"I’ve had this phone for months and no complaints, at first i though the battery did work but that was my fault, but other than that the phone is great works with any service!!"
1118,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Just got it yesterday so far it works good and the battery compacity is at 93% and thats good. You can use any carrier for this unlocked phone. The phone doesn’t come with a screen protector or case you have to buy it yourself. But so far it’s working well all around. Ill give another update in a week to see how its still working.  (Took this pictures on my old broken phone & my back camera is broken, sorry for the blurry picture)"
1119,"El reconocimiento facial no lo califique porque no lo probé y no lo utilizo. Lo demás todo perfecto hasta el momento, tanto la batería como la calidad de la pantalla! Lo recomiendo !!!!"
1120,Bad ear speaker
1121,"I paid for the Amazon Renewed PREMIUM for the 1 year warranty.  When I rcvd the phone, it took me all day to setup cause the phone had to update first.  After I had it setup and my info uploaded onto it, I immediately noticed issues.1) The ringer was extremely muffled on incoming calls.2) The touch screen was not responsive much of the time.3) The screen would not go into sleep mode and lock when pushing the power button without pushing it multiple times.Given that it was an Amazon Renewed Premium phone (supposed to be like new), I wanted a replacement phone.  Which is one of the options listed on the Renewed Premium terms.  BUT when I contacted Amazon TWICE I was told they could not send me a replacement.  They said I would have to return it, then, (AFTER I received my refund), I would have to reorder another one.  The price of the phone had already gone up and it took a week for Amazon to issue my refund AFTER they received the phone back!!!And now they don’t even have the phone available!!Don’t waste your money on Amazon Renewed PREMIUM because Amazon does NOT honor their own terms!!"
1122,"I'd say the refurbished iPhone I received was in 9/10 condition. The only mark was, of course, on the screen. It was not noticeable when the screen is on but you could see it when the screen was off. I was pleased that the seller I got it from included a case and screen protector with it (not sure if they all come with those). Lucky for me, the screen protector made the mark on the screen no longer visible, so I'm not concerned about it. The phone works like new and the battery life seems excellent. Based on this experience I'd buy another refurbished phone from Amazon."
1123,First one the screen had many deep scratches and a  small crack ... I returned and receive one with scratches but no cracks. I keep it as my daughter cant wait to use it but was not impressed . Phone has been working fine other than that.
1124,"Good as a back up work phone, phone looks brand new. Battery has depleted a little but is to be expected from a used phone."
1125,"I bought this because I needed a new phone and the XR was perfect! MobileSpree was a good seller because the device looked brand new with no scratches on either side of the phone. However one thing I noticed was that the phone was full of gunk around the edges and both speakers, but I just cleaned it off with sanitized wipes and rubbing alcohol with q-tips for the speakers. The battery health was at 92% which was better than what I expected but I expected at least 100% since I’ve had other phones arrive with a new battery."
1126,"Perfect phone, but the screen was very scratched"
1127,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 When I saw the price i was a bit skeptical of the product. So much so I even recorded myself opening it just in case, but i was pleasantly surprised with the results. Would definitely recommend this."
1128,"I had to replace my iPhone 7 Plus.  This is a great replacement: same size and weight, easy setup (as expected), and the phone is in great shape."
1129,"When ordered this phone I was worried with the review I had noticed on here. To be honest I don’t know what people are complaining about. I got this phone and it pretty much looked brand new. Yes you get a after market power cord and charger, but it tells you this in the description. So if you didn’t notice it, it’s on you not them. I love this phone, I use to have an IPhone 6 and had it ever since it first came out. I felt it was time to upgrade to this one. I’m so happy I decided on getting this one. Love everything about this phone and the amazing pictures it takes. Had a lot new features that I love. Even the little one if you text pew pew to someone. I love it."
1130,Hi the phone functions well and looks good. However the back camera looks a bit hazy.
1131,My personal phone use.
1132,"I ordered this phone when mine broke, and didn't read any reviews (which was a dumb move on my part of course). I read the reviews two days later and was getting very nervous about how it was going to be. I trusted amazon renewed, and I must say, I wasn't disappointed. My phone didn't have a scratch on it at all whatsoever, and works completely fine. The only problem or concern I have is that the battery is at 88%. But that's what you can expect from a refurbished phone, mine is from the seller: ""Electronic Deals."""
1133,"I purchased the blue XR, and while it came in perfect condition and the phone itself was of great quality, I did not like its size, which is purely personal preference. Other than that, I thought the phone was great in every way. Outstanding battery and display. Although the phone was of great quality, the size of the screen gave me headaches due to my severe brain damage, so I returned my product and have received nothing but wonderful customer service. I had gotten a reply just a couple hours after emailing BUYSPRY and was met with a very kind and informative email. I will certainly be recommending this company to friends and family because of their customer service. Hope this helps others."
1134,Take’s horrible pics
1135,Was very pleased with my X-R iPhone when I received it . Everything worked perfect and phone was in excellent condition with no scratches. Would highly recommend these renewed phones from Prime .
1136,I needed a upgrade and couldn’t afford 1000 plus on a phone this was perfect for what I needed!
1137,"No issues to this point, good phone, exactly as expected.  We are satisfied."
1138,Great condition love it. Big upgrade coming from a 6 plus.
1139,"When I ordered this product, I did not expect the phone to be as great as a condition it was in. First off, the phone came with a Genuine Apple Charger (instead of those cheap 3rd party ones). Secondly, when I powered on and set up the phone, I was shocked to find out that the Phone was only 1 month old and the warranty was still good for another 11 months! And when I went to check the battery capacity, it was at 100% battery capacity and was really well taken care of. Despite all of this, I did find a few scratches on the back, but it’s hardly noticeable and everything else about this iPhone XR is flawless and I was even able to purchase AppleCare+ for only $12.99 a month. I purchased this item through ChubbiesTech and will definitely do business with this company In the near future!"
1140,This item works very well. It was fully unlocked as per the advert. The only scratch was on the charging area. The battery life is really good. The charger is a not an original iPhone one but works perfectly fine. All the way in South Africa
1141,"I’m really enjoying my phone so far!! I ordered it on Sunday 09/19 and I received my phone on 09/23 even though the app said it was going to arrive on Friday! So I got it a whole two days earlier! And the phone arrived with no cracks, very few blemishes noticeable, a screen protector, and a phone charger, Also fully unlocked as mentioned in the phone summary. The phone as mentioned doesn’t come with headphones which I knew about, I already have headphones anyway. The phone battery life is at 95%. I’m loving this phone so far and I’m so happy and I went for it! After screening the reviews for WEEKS on end I’m very satisfied with my purchase :)"
1142,"I was skeptical at first ordering a phone off of Amazon instead of a phone store, but the great price had me sold. My phone came with a charger. No earbuds. (the description said it didn’t have one which was fine.) battery was at 90% capacity, and it came with a screen protector already installed! I’m pretty sure I just got lucky since I read that not many people got one with one already on the phone. Overall, I’m going to be buying refurbished phones from here from now on!"
1143,"The battery life isn't the best but the phone didn't overhead, it's fast, the face resonation was amazing definitely buy this phone."
1144,"You wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between used and new. My son loves it, nice upgrade from his iPhone 8"
1145,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I like how it came in a short period of time, case is nice, but there is scratches around the camera, and the screen malfunctions, some areas don’t work, and those same areas every now and then it will randomly start clicking, and I reset the phone and it still does it, other than that works fine"
1146,I needed a new phone. I did not want to spend major amounts of money on a new phone so I started looking at reconditioned phones. I am usually pretty skeptical about reconditioned items but thought I would try this one. I am very happy with my purchase and it seemed to be better than the description on their site. It showed up on time and even had a way to return it if needed.
1147,It came with a 86% battery health. Couldn’t hear out of the ear piece — had to clean the little screen and it still doesn’t sound clear. The other day the screen shut down completely and I had to hard reset the phone to get it to work again. I brought the phone to Brazil — can’t even return it.I don’t recommend.
1148,Came in in 5 days. Phone looks and works like its brand new. This is the second amazon phone for me.
1149,"I can’t tell the difference at all between this refurbished phone for much much cheaper and a brand new iPhone XR. Simply amazing. It weighs, feels, looks, sounds, performs, and retains battery life to the same degree as a brand new one. Makes no sense not to buy it."
1150,Worth it for the money my ex still have she have no issues
1151,"I really enjoy all aspects of this phone except for the battery life, but I’m sure that could be due to a setting."
1152,I’m giving it a four star. The phone physically was amazing and perfect no scratches. Nothing. Unfortunately I use cricket and as soon as I activated my sims into my new iPhone XR my account was suspended cricket said it was blacklisted. However I spoke with apple and apple said the phone is not blacklisted they even spoke with the cricket carrier and cricket said it was a glitch I. Their system so after reading reviews on rocket ive realized they have this “glitch” very often. The phone if you are not with cricket will be a great BUY- I would personally buy this phone again if I wasn’t with cricket-
1153,Great deal !
1154,Really enjoy the photos we toke
1155,"Top earpiece speaker and mic were not working. No sound was coming out and people couldn't hear me nor I could hear them while calling. Plus the music was quiet too. Tried cleaning it which helped a bit but still was really bad. Had to take it to the certified shop to get it properly cleaned, which did help a lot, and thankfully the seller did cover the cost of it. However, I still have issues with mic as other people sometimes say they suddenly can't hear me well, even though I didn't move at all.Moreover, I just now realised that SELLER DELETED MY PREVIOUS BAD REVIEW A MONTH AGO, so it could look better. That is unacceptable and untrustworthy from them to hide honest opinion, only so they would look better for the next buyer. They refunded me the cost of cleaning it so I would have given it 3 stars (because its still not working properly), but not happy about them hiding the bad reviews."
1156,"The camera is not super sensitive during the night and will not always see your face even if there is a little light, there has to be enough ( like a night light amount) for the camera to pick up enough of your face to unlock."
1157,"I just finished setting up my XR. I bought a red 64 GB from Renewed Premium for $440. The phone is in mint condition with 100% battery health. I am very pleased, especially considering the fact that I have 1 whole year to return the phone for a full refund. I have no current plans to do so because I love the phone so far, but that’s an incredible deal. So for $60 less than retail I basically got a new phone with a 1 year window to return with 0 risk (unless I seriously damage the phone for whatever reason). Give Renewed a try, especially if you can get a phone with Renewed Premium."
1158,"When purchasing this phone case the pictures as well as the video provides the impression that the plexi glass is covered with a second cover and that is not the case.  The company provudes a black outer barrier that only fits by itself not with the back clear case cover.  Therefore it's either or not both at the same time.  I decided to go with the clear back cover and the plexi glass, so far its working."
1159,I like how it was almost brand new it stopped working 4 days later not sure if my fault or not but maybe something about the battery
1160,I bought this phone a few months ago and I’m very happy with it I got it in coral and the colors beautiful the phone works well and for me it came with a screen protector all I needed was a case I would buy this again.
1161,Except it now needs a new LCD. That's Iphones for ya.
1162,Had the phone less than a month and battery health has gone down over 5% and periodically  get water in charging cord when the various cords are all new.  Has not come in contact with water and occasionally get this message not on this phone.
1163,This was probably the best experience I’ve had buying anything on Amazon. Not only was the product exactly as described but they even sent me a case and screen protector. Definitely would buy again from this vendor.
1164,"I don’t know if this is just how the XRs Speakers sound, but I highly doubt it. My iPhone X broke about 3 days ago and the volume buttons stopped working and the phone would get incredibly hot. I’ve had the phone for 3-4 years so I decided now is a fair time to get a replacement. The XR isn’t much of an upgrade- more like a change. I’m not sure if the refurbished phone I received was previously exposed to water and the speakers suffered from that or what happened, but they sound much more quiet than my X and it has a very crackly sound when any noise is going on, like a weak but very noticeable static sound- it’s hard to explain. Overall I’m happy with the XR but either the one I received was previously damaged or apple really messed up the speakers here."
1165,"I couldn’t found a last mine XR for my son, so when I seen this one I had to get it,He was so excited & it look & work like new,Thank you so much & I will buy something else soon!"
1166,Se aprecia muchos desgaste y golpes.
1167,Phone was in awesome condition cosmetically. I did however send it back. I think I got a random one that had some hardware issues. Unless it was the operator. 😊 But my tech savvy son with the same iPhone agreed something wasn't right. Would still highly recommend! Luck of the draw. Company great to work with.
1168,"This arrived perfectly wrapped and sealed up all nice and neat. I’m not sure what was wrong with it, but the screen and body are immaculate, the battery life is excellent, and everything else works perfect. Also, super excited because I got the color I asked for, which in the past hasn’t happened. Easy setup, did have to do a factory reset though"
1169,"Looks brand new, came with screen protector. Very happy with purchase. Reasonable price"
1170,"I would like to specify I purchased the phone from the seller ChubbiesTech! First of all, I received the package a day early (bonus points🥳) It did not come in the Apple packaging but that’s ok with me. The screen is in perfect conditions!  Overall the phone is 10/10 basically new! I was skeptical about this phone but honestly, no regrets! I bought it for my mom and I will buy another one for me. Also, it did come with a charger. The screen quality is perfect and it’s extremely responsive like any other iPhone.. if you ask me, don’t think twice, BUY IT! (From chubbiestech)"
1171,"This is a good Iphone if you want to gamble your money. Luckily with the Amazon 90 Day thing you should be fine, the first time I ordered it, it looked fine, but the touchscreen DIDN'T work at ALL. Luckily I was able to send it back for a new phone for free, and they sent me it, and it's been working fine, battery, face ID, charging, connecting, wifi, TOUCHSCREEN as well.So there's about a 50/50 chance you either get a good iphone, or a bad one, which in that case you could just send back for a new one.I'll try to update this review in a few weeks/months if anything goes wrong."
1172,Got this phone a few days ago and finally set it up. I love it so far but the only complaint is the lack of ability to close out all apps at once and to close the apps you have to swipe up slowly from the bottom on the screen. It works but it takes a little practice to get used to it since I switched from a Galaxy S8.
1173,"This is a solid deal. As to be expected with buying anything used, it’s kind of a game of chance. But from using this phone for over a month now I have no complaints. A few minor dings and dents here and there but nothing noticeable. It’s apparent that this phone us some replaced parts but again nothing that affects the usability of the device. I would definitely recommend to anyone who’s trying to snag a good deal."
1174,"It came a day earlier than expected. There was A few scratches on the top right corner of the screen but that is what you get with a refurbished phone, other than that its perfect! it even came with a real iphone charger and a very nice/sturdy clear case. Im not going to lie i was a bit nervous because of the horrible review section. However the speakers work perfectly. The screen is bright and vibrant! Im very satisfied with this purchase. I got the coral pink, iphone xr, through chubbiestech* i suggest anyone making this purchase, to definitely go through them. Ill update if anything goes array. Thank you chubbiestech!"
1175,Deben revisar mejor
1176,Speakers have damage.
1177,Looks great. Works fine. Battery health as described but hoping for better. Facial recognition not working as well as on my other kid’s xr phones.
1178,I was hoping to exchange this phone for a new one but the time frame closed to exchange. When talking to someone on the phone it’s very hard to hear them without putting it on speaker and obviously I don’t want to talk on the speaker during all of my calls.
1179,Would have given a better review but the back of the phone does not have the apple on it as advertised it was a birthday gift for my son will see how he likes it but I would have preferred to know that the back was replaced all that was mentioned was side damage.
1180,Renewed phone.Flawless screen with a screen protector. The phone JS zero scratches. Battery max 84% (the description said 80% or better). Unlocked.Good purchase.
1181,"great product! received it earlier then expected, phone was unlocked and ready."
1182,"Got my Amazon Renewed iPhone XR from TRADEMORE. As advertised, the ""renewed"" phone //could// come with a 90% battery health. Yep, it showed up with a 92% battery health. If you think that's an ""A"" and it must have 92 more percents to go before it's dead, you're mistaken...At 80% battery health, Apple flags your phone as ""significantly degraded"" and notes that it is in need of service to function correctly and reliably. Around that time, Apple throttles your device performance to keep it alive on a charge. What this means is that 80% means your phone is in ""hospice care"" and less, you're dead. That means that a 90% battery health stat means your phone has only 50% of its remaining potential charges left before Apple deems your phone ready to leave this world.In simplest terms, ""Amazon Renewed"" appears to mean; Phones that were well cared for aesthetically, but whose internals are heavily used, abused, and at half-life. When I made this purchase, I *hoped* the 90% threshold was a legal 'cover our aces' move, but turns out not -- turns out a half-beat phone with 200 charges left before Apple deems the device unreliable is what you get.Buyer beware. Apple charges $69 to replace an XR battery, so take this cost, add $69, and that's the actual cost of this ""renewed"" device.Otherwise, I'm sure the brand new, $700 iPhone XR is a real gem! Love the shape, feel, and usability of this machine."
1183,"Been 3 months since purchase, and it's perfect still batter life is great, I've had zero issues with this device"
1184,"it runs everything so smoothly, the screen on the front and back were in mint condition! the phone comes with a charger and a screen protector, and everything was just so phenomenal.the low reviews made me really wary but it’s everything i hoped for, will buy from the shop again when i want an upgrade! :D"
1185,Excelente
1186,My Partner had a 7S and she started playing games on her phone and it was very slow do I suggested she needed to upgrade so my nephew suggested Amazon as we all say Amazon has EVERYTHING so I checked with you guys and she loves her new (to her) phone. I’ve created a monster now all she dies is play games.
1187,I did not notice any noticeable scratches and the phone looked like new. Will definitely consider renewed phones next time.
1188,"I have been using this phone for a few months now, and it is has caused me no real issues. The only slight compliant I have is that the speakers sound like they have been water damaged. I am assuming that the phone was water damaged and repaired, but I am not completely sure about that of course. But again, the phone has been working great and I love it. I just simply use headphones when I want to listen to phone or talk on the phone"
1189,The item is glitchy during FaceTime which is one of the primary reasons why my daughter wanted an iPhone!
1190,The whole phone itself that I love. The charger it came with was questionable but it works perfectly fine. Best purchase of my paycheck. :))
1191,The iphone arrived well packaged. The phone looked new and was easy to navigate the menus.
1192,I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase ! I’ll admit I was weary of buying a IPhone from the internet but the seller was amazing 👌😊The phone came before the date promised which was extremely fast ! There’s no cracks glitches nada just a clear nice iPhone I was able to hook it up with my carrier immediately  I just put my SIM card in and boom service was instant !!!! Thankyou so much ! Oh and the phone also comes with a charger just in case anyone was wondering  I definitely will be buying again ❤️❤️❤️👌👌👌
1193,"Muy bien parece nuevo, solo el empaque no me gusto no venia bien protegido solo en una bolsita de plástico y una de burbujas pero no muy protegido además un día estaba vibrando mucho no se porque pero esta bien nos gusto mucho"
1194,I bought the phone for my son birthday. The phone is fully unlocked only thing is. It’s not a real iPhone. Apple couldn’t find out where the phone was made. I couldn’t take it to any phone carriers cause it’s a fake iPhone great for ya toddlers tho
1195,This is a great phone for the money ... We had no issues and would definitely make a purchase for here again
1196,It’s awesome no problems so far
1197,"Was very hesitant to order a ""Renewed"" product and after reading a bunch of reviews I decided to jump in and give it a go.  Glad I did. The phone arrived in 2 days which was almost a week earlier than estimated. The iPhone looked brand new and I really couldn't find any imperfections whatsoever.  The battery health maximum capacity is 98% so I'm very pleased.  The iPhone XR blows away my Pixel 3 XL in performance and is comparable in camera quality.  Decided to take the plunge with the Apple Watch 5 and after reading multiple reviews, the iPhone XR is the best bang for your buck.  Glad I paid a little extra for the 128 GB.  If your hesitant about trying a Renewed product...don't be.Revised my original review from 5 to 2 stars.  Recently noticed that my phone had a screen protector on it that I didn't originally see.  Took the screen protector off to reveal the original unprotected screen and voila there wear a bunch of noticeable scratches in to horizontal bands that were masked by the screen protector.  DECEPTIVE.  I would have sent it back right away had I noticed earlier.  The rest of the phone is fine but the shady way the screen was presented has left a bad taste in my mouth.  May not be too late to send it back."
1198,"I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my iPhone 7plus other than it missing a fave feature of mine, the 3D Touch this phone is definitely an upgrade.The quality of the device I received was decent. No obvious scratches, dings, or issues. The main complaint I have is that every about ten minutes of use or so, my screen is unresponsive. I have to completely click off my screen and reopen my device to regain control of the screen again. Idk what the issue is but I have updated the device, turned it all the way off and on again so now my only hunch, is that it was due to this being a refurbished device. I just wish it was disclosed in the product description.I feel with this malfunction the value for money isn’t quite there, but that’s what I get for purchasing online I suppose.Buyers please purchase with caution and knowledge that you may receive a device that only works sometimes!"
1199,Overall I like the phone.  I didn’t have any problems
1200,"I loved everything about the IPhone XR, the display is very nice, just large enough to easy see what's going on. For the size of it , it was surprisingly light.I definitely would have kept it, if it wasn't that I needed the best camera possible just for my work.(I am a Micro-blading technician, taking pictures of my work)So, in short if you need a great phone with a great camera for everyday use then the IPhone XR is the sure one to buy. I like the IPhone XR actually better then the IPhone 11Pro that i have now. But again the camera for work made the decision for me."
1201,"This phone is amazing! Excellent features. Phone was like new, and the seller sent it so quick. I literally received it the next day (no lie). I just don't get used to iPhone anymore. Maybe if they were a bit more unrestricted like androids. But besides that this phone is awesome! Totally recommend it."
1202,"I am extremely satisfied. The iPhone XR seemed brand new, no scratches or dents and charger was included. A SIM card is not included, but that’s no big deal. If you are upgrading, take out the SIM card from your old phone & insert in the new phone. Or in my case, I bought this phone for one of my new employees. All I had to do was take it to AT&T (any wireless provider will work) and they added a SIM card and got the phone and new phone number activated immediately."
1203,"Boo yah! My phone came in mint condition with an Apple charger.Something people need to know about newer iPhones is the materials have changed. Opposed to older models that were more scratch resistant but more prone to shattering when dropped, the newer models traded in the scratch resistance factor for higher durability and less likelihood of shattering occurring. There’s a coating on it and yes, you will ABSOLUTELY need not only a proper case for this phone, but also a screen protector. I did not know this until after purchasing this phone and noticed some minor cosmetic scratches from my light usage.My unsolicited advice if buying is to also purchase a case and screen protector simultaneously so you don’t have to deal with scratching. Both can be found on Amazon together for under $20 total.Unless you’re totally rich and don’t care. Then do whatever you want because this is probably your back up back up iPhone."
1204,It was a good price and works good as well
1205,"Since it’s only being used for texts and calls at this point, the battery hasn’t been strained. And they included a phone case."
1206,This phone was a huge upgrade in many ways from my iPhone 8! To start the amount of screen that is present is a huge upgrade. The bezel for the camera and speaker at the top is very sleek and Hardly noticeable. The camera is also fantastic! The portrait photos that you can with this phone with both cameras is fantastic! Also the screen resolution is beautiful and allows great streaming of videos. The battery life is much much stronger than the life of my older model. This phone lasts all day for me! The price is also great compared to some other apple phones! Also this phone will work with any carries since it is unlocked
1207,Item was in fair condition which isn't the reason I returned it but because the speakers were clogged up with dirt -returned the very hour shipment arrived
1208,Good for the price
1209,Good!!! At first I was worried bc I was reading reviews of how it wasn’t working and peoples phones were glitching. My phone works well and I’ve had it for about 4 months now. When I received it it was minor scratches but other than that the phone was In good condition
1210,Would recommend to anyone who feels iffy about buying an iPhone off Amazon it works perfectly and looks good
1211,This product is better than I imagined.  This iPhone could pass as brand new.  Very happy with my purchase.
1212,excellent product for an excellent price
1213,"This phone came on time and had no cracks, scratches, etc. Battery levels were at 100"
1214,Got if for a week.  It works pretty good!
1215,Discovered after having this phone for a few weeks that the function for Apple Pay and using Apple Wallet for tickets to events (like an NHL game) did not work.  Took it to the Apple Store and they could do nothing.  The phone will be returned and a replacement ordered.
1216,"As advertised.  It is used and there are wear and tear, but it works and so far so good.  There is a charger and Apple Lightening to USB  A cable + screen shield.  Nothing fancy, but it's all there."
1217,"I have never made a review for a product i’ve ordered on amazon, but this phone reached my expectations and much more if i’m being honest. As most people have mentioned in the reviews, I was also very skeptical about this product because of the negative reviews some people were leaving, but the phone I received was in perfect condition no scratches at all. The battery life it came with was 97% which is great, I have a little over a month with this phone and I couldn’t be happier with this purchase."
1218,"Everything works pretty well. No scratches or any type of damages. My only complaint is the batter percentage. It's takimg 1 percent per min. I ONLY USED THE PHONE FOR 5-6 MINS AND IT ALREADY TOOK 5% OF THE BATTERY. But overall, it works okay. I still recomment it"
1219,I received my iPhone XR today from Kiss Electronics  and I was very impressed. The phone was in very good condition (no noticeable scratches or dents) and came with a charger and cable.  A screen protector was even affixed. The battery was charged to more than 90 percent.  I was able to set up my Apple ID and face ID recognition.  My Sim card from my other phone was instantly recognized on the iPhone and I had to configure no other settings to get it to work.I am highly impressed with this purchase and would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat!
1220,"the phone looks amazing, no dents, scratches or any defect.  battery health is at 88% which does not affect its operation.  Came with charger and well packaged.  Buy without fear."
1221,"Although the phone arrived dead, once it charged up, it seemed to be running okay. The health of the battery was also 100%!!! As an unlocked phone,  it did not register for my Verizon or Tmobile. It kept indicating phone not allowed for both sim cards. Since I was using it for tmobile and the IMEI was not recognized online, I had to call and the process was completed in 5 minutes and the phone worked instantly.The seller does indicate on the box, not to provide the IMEI number, but in this situation I had to, since it did not work for both carriers, but I did not encounter any problems with the t-mobile representative."
1222,Battery life at 80%. Looks almost new and works perfectly.
1223,"I was very hesitant to purchase a renewed iPhone but I am so glad that I did! This was my first time purchasing a renewed phone and its basically like brand new! The phone only had very minor scratches on the apple logo on the back of the phone that is not even noticeable. The screen did not have any scratches. The touch screen, camera and face ID is working perfectly well so far. Phone came with 90% battery health. I had no issues with inserting my sim card, it connected to my network right away. I will definitely purchase renewed phones in the future!"
1224,"I am wanting a FULL REFUND. This phone is STOLEN. I just went through AMAZON and tried to request a return & I  am currently waiting for the seller to respond. The phone did not come with a charger nor a manual. Upon inquiring about that, they ""emailed"" me a copy of a manual. Did not address the issue about the charger. I've spent nearly my entire day (6/17/2020) at an At&t Corporate Store. The phone came in what looked to be great aesthetic condition in a clear bag inside a regular cardboard box(No original packaging at all). I went to AT&T to have the phone activated. After trying repeatedly to activate the phone over a time frame of 5 hours, they proceeded to ask me where I purchased the phone from. I advised them and showed them the receipt information. They advised me that they were trying to activate the phone but, kept running into multiple error issues with the SIM and phone ID. They input new SIM's, etc. The representative got the phone to activate for a minimum of about 7 minutes total. After activating the rep tried to make a call to verify that the phone operated and the phone dial tone gave an error message of  ""blocked from network use"". The at&t representative and a manager messed with it multiple times and could not get it to work. The supervisor at that point advised us that AT&T along with all the other cellular companies monitor SIM cards and phone ID's for stolen or lost traffic. This phone was apparently reported stolen according to the phone ID. She stated they would not activate it, refused to give the phone back to me until I called the cops, and filled out a report. I've contacted the Seller with a message requesting them to GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK ASAP as I want to send this stolen phone back to them. I want NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. A police report has been filed."
1225,"The phone arrived in brand new condition in terms of both appearance and functionality. I did see some bad reviews which made me nervous, but I, fortunately, did not experience any issues. The phone was covered in protective plastic and safely packaged in the box with a charger as described and expected.For those of you who’s worry that your phone may not be compatible with your carrier or SIM you can check directly through your carrier to see if the phone is compatible, and, if so, which SIM Card/Part is also compatible for the specific device with your carrier (not all SIM cards are created equally and an incompatible SIM could lead you to think that the phone itself is not compatible or “fully unlocked” when it is, actually).Overall, 10/10 experience with this phone and vendor!I hope that this helps alleviate some stress for someone and lead you to a positive new phone experience!"
1226,"I was a little skeptical from some other reviews but the phone was packaged nicely and arrived way earlier than expected! Phone already had a screen protector on it, and came with a new charging cable and plug in!  (Very useful because with iPhones you can never have enough cables) Very satisfied overall, no issues with the phone. Phone is in beautiful condition aside from a tiny scuff in the right corner but aside from that no scratches or cracks. Phone was fully unlocked and switched to my carrier very easily. Very satisfied thank you guys!"
1227,
1228,The people i purchased the phone for like it very much
1229,"The best battery charge my iPhone could get is at 84%. The box it came in said 87%… wish that was at least 90%, but other than that it works well."
1230,I love it! Thanks!
1231,I bought this phone for my sister and she loves it. It came in great condition and it was unlocked. So far so good.
1232,"I ordered this device only 2 days ago and it came faster than expected. The phone itself is great for a renewed phone and the camera quality is perfect. The only two downsides is that the maximum capacity for battery life is only 89% and there are small scratches near the speaker and battery hole. The scratches aren't as visible though. So, all in all a 9/10."
1233,Awsome
1234,Phone is like new!  Battery works great.  A great value
1235,100% legit. Its the phone im using now lol. Have had this for about 2 years and I love it.
1236,Phone is working perfect! Looks like a brand new phone! Came on time! Battery is at 98 percent life! No scratches or marks
1237,Phone came in perfect physical and working condition! Thanks a lot!
1238,Bought for my daughter to replace her old iPhone 8 with a broken screen.  Didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a phone for my teenager.  This phone looks brand new and works perfectly.  She is very happy with it and so am I.
1239,The phone came on time and it looked better than I expected it would look for a used phone definitely worth the price
1240,I bought this phone about two years ago now and it's still like new! Love it
1241,Espero y dure
1242,"Let me start by saying that the product arrived two days early which never happens! Activated easily and downloaded my iCloud without any issues. Looks and works like a new iPhone, I was hesitant about the Face ID at first but it’s amazing (i work as a mechanic and I don’t have to worry as much about greasy hands and the finger print scanner.) the battery life has been very good so far, I upgraded from the iPhone 7 so the camera is much much better quality but that’s to be expected with technology upgrading the way it does."
1243,I like everything about it I had to switch back from android to iPhone so I heard the XR was good. I got this refurbished cause it’s cheap.The only thing I dislike no button but I’m getting used to not having a button.
1244,"I love my phone! Works great, and came in 2 days from ordering. I’m completely satisfied with my purchase!"
1245,"Battery life decayed quickly after only a few months so must jave already seen some hard use, screen died 7 months after purchase which is outside of 3 month warranty so not covered by Amazon or seller. Yes it's preowned in otherwise great condition, but buyer beware."
1246,Phone is in excellent condition for being renewed. Everything works as it should.
1247,The phone had no charge. A crack on front and a lot of scratches. I understand it was a refurbished phone
1248,Price goodBut doesn’t have original Apple battery
1249,I bought this phone off of amazon and was very hesitant about this because I was unable to hold it and see if I actually like it. Well this product did not disappoint. Not only is this phone more affordable than any phone at Verizon but I have had it for a year now and it is working just like it was when I got it out of the package. Also it is not hard to transfer the phone on to an already existing account with some one like Verizon. Even though it is a lot of money out of the pocket it is still cheaper than purchasing a phone in store because it has helped me save on my monthly bill a TON! So yes BUY THIS PRODUCT
1250,Overall it's a good phone
1251,It’s was a good phone refurbished like said in great quality all I had to do was charge it and pop in my sim would have been 5 star if my battery life was at 99% or 100% but I even at the 98% percent battery life it last all day.
1252,"This is the second purchase from this vendor, so far, so good"
1253,Returned
1254,                    The media could not be loaded.                 It works really good. I never ordered a refurbished phone before so I didn’t really know what to expect but after I dropped it the screen starts to mess up a little but I thinks that’s my fault lol but I totally recommend!!!
1255,"It is literally perfect! I ordered this for myself, i had an old iphone and needed to update it. I was nervous buying it off of amazon instead of directly from apple but it was cheaper and easier than going to an apple store, considering corona. It came in three days after i ordered it, even though it said it wouldnt be here until next week. there are NO scratches at all, the battery life is 100% and came with an 80% charge. It was perfect. If anyone is looking for an iphone, i do highly suggest this one. the sound is wonderful, as well as the camera quality. its a really good phone. ive been an apple user for a while and im certainly not disappointed."
1256,"This was purchased as a gift and the recipient loves it. Looks and functions just like brand new and the battery, as promised, still had 87% capacity which goes a long way for iPhones. It’s been over a month now and still no issues whatsoever so can confidently say would buy again and recommend to others. The XR was his first iPhone coming from android so he’s not very picky, it’s an upgrade all around. This phone seemed like a good option for a less expensive entry to apple iPhones."
1257,"In excellent condition, worth paying a little more for renewed premium."
1258,"If you're moving up from an older iPhone (iPhone 6S for me) take some time to learn the new screen actions, especially since the bottom button is missing. But once you get accustomed to the finger swiping it's pretty cool. The facial recognition seems to work when it wants to. Glad you can still code in as well."
1259,It is amazing. no further response
1260,"Phone is acceptable not excellent condition. Has scratches on edges of screen and camera. Battery life is at 71% not above 80%. When in use , phone dies in about 3 hours from charging overnight."
1261,"I was super skeptical of buying this phone just like a lot of people probably are. However everything about this phone was basically brand new without a single scratch. My only complaint is the battery life was at 90% max rather than 100% but I do understand the phone is used so obviously it will be slightly under top tier. It was completely unlocked, everything about it was like I walked out of the apple store with it. It’s definitely worth the buy if you are looking for a new phone."
1262,I was a little worried ordering this with everything that’s been going ok and I didn’t want to get scammed but I always check the reviews on things and I seen more good reviews than bad reviews so I just decided to get it a shot and order this phone my husband were trying to pay for the phone with our carrier but it’s was just a headache because only certain stores had them so we just bought it. I’m glad we did because it’s just like brand new no scratch or anything my husband was able to plug his SIM card right up and it’s started working instantly. Get it you won’t regret it I love this phone .
1263,This is the second time I’ve ordered from this company and I have never had a problem with either one of my phones!!!! Will continue to order from this company!!!!
1264,"I use straight talk through Verizon towers and this phone works perfectly for this. The only problem I had was when setting up the phone I had to create a Apple ID but got a message saying that the phone has had too many people make a new ID on it, so I just skipped that part. After setting up the phone, I went back to the settings and tried setting up an ID again, and this time it let me do it. Not sure what was up there but just an FYI. Other than that this phone is perfect, and I am very happy with my purchase. Mine came with charger only, but phone had no scuffs or scratches."
1265,"Started looking on Craigslist, Swappa and eBay for a low-cost replacement for a dying iPhone 6, and saw a positive customer review for Amazon Renewed/Refurbished on one of those sites. I liked the Amazon return policy, and the ability to spend more or less on a Fair, Good, Excellent or Mint-condition phone. The XR I bought was refurbished by HQtronic, and was a mint-condition, no scratches, and battery at 94% capacity for a great price. And, backed by the Amazon return policy. HQtronic even got the phone to me in 48 hours at no additional cost! I am totally pleased with this deal, and will definitely go out of my way to shop these guys again!!!"
1266,Love my new Red XR everything works perfectly
1267,The device came with a tear on the side. I paid for an excellent device and I feel
1268,Amazon “Renewed Premium “ is a waste of extra money. If you must buy from Amazon buy new or just regular renewed! The extra you pay for the premium is a rip off. The only difference is it comes in a bigger box. It’s a joke. I’ve bought a few other phones from Amazon both New and renewed and the renewed phones are the same as the premium only without the “premium “ price!!!!! And don’t bother contacting Amazon about it because they could care less. Sure sit back and wait a month for your refund. No more for me.
1269,"Okay so all the bad reviews are from the old seller, this new seller is honestly amazing, my phone came unlocked no problems and near mint condition (only 1 small scratch on my screen)  this was awesome i was debating to get it here or apple but no regrets. if your not sure how any carrier works buy the ""UNLOCKED"" option, it'll work for every carrier. mine also came with 90% battery life, speakers worked perfectly, facial recognition worked perfectly, everything worked perfectly."
1270,So far I have not encountered any issues that I have read in previous reviews. My speakers have been working fine and no problems with call clarity.
1271,"I haven't used the phone much yet, but I am very pleased with the product that I received.  As far as I can tell, it's new. No difference, except for the generic charger and cable, but that was expected. Seller merits the positive reviews.Update:  I finally set up the phone.  Everything seems to work fine, but the speaker seems to be damaged.  Contacted the seller directly.  Will wait to see the the response.  Staying optimistic since the vendor got great ratings.Update: Seller is great and the replacement phone is working like a new phone."
1272,"Good condition, battery life came 89%"
1273,"There are a lot of bad reviews out there so I thought I should share that I’ve had my phone for a week and it has done fine. It is really hard to trust a company that only has bad views, and phones are never always perfect. I actually only bought this phone because I saw another guy who got a yellow one and it was fine. I also got yellow because it was the cheapest option for me.  It has been a week. Good so far. It was unlocked, had no cosmetic damage and I had to set it up with my iCloud account just like normal. It’s been great and I’ll update if it’s not.Edit: I had the phone for nearly two years before I replaced it but it was still useable. It was great all in all."
1274,It was way past time to get a newer phone. I love the features such as the face recognition! And the battery life! I'm older and it's going to take me a bit to learn all the fun things it can do but now I have the power to do it! The screen quality and clarity of the photos is so much more than I could have  hoped for. I couldn't be any happier with my purchase.
1275,Works great. Connected with my current plan with no problem.
1276,"I thought everything was basically perfect the only thing is it won’t let me download the YouTube App onto my phone, I even spoke with Apple support and went through every which way to try and let me download it but it still wouldn’t let me, im not sure if it’s because I bought its renewed or off of amazon... I honestly don’t really understand exactly what the problem is because it will let me download any other app, it’s alright though I guess I can just watch YouTube off of safari, but yeah basically that was the one and only problem I found with the product other than that it’s great!"
1277,"The phone is a bit slippery, but it is great. It is very light unless you put phone case on it."
1278,I love this. Bought it for my mom and now I’m the favorite daughter!!😎
1279,"Product arrived a day early. It included a screen protector and a case which was a nice surprise. No issues, looks like it was never used. Will definitely purchase from again!!!"
1280,Brought this for my daughter. She loved the color and it does the job
1281,"Phone came in perfect shape, had obviously been packed well for shipping and has performed as expected!"
1282,"Got it as a gift for my teenage son, he loves it. No issues with it at all. No cracks, scratches or glitches. Works like new. Super happy with the phone… Will purchase again when needed."
1283,I like every thing about the phone and everything work perfectly fine
1284,Everything ok now
1285,"I got my phone yesterday and is working good so far, the battery is on 90% wish it was higher but overall it works perfectly fine! I recommend this!"
1286,Big decent
1287,"AMAZING phone. i previously had a 7. Came with charger cord and block, good packaging. Has scratches on the screen mainly at the top but they are BARELY visible and it’s expected. The only way I see them is when i flash a light and look REALLY close. No dents, good battery (90%), AMAZING camera. The reviews were very troubling but i went with my gut and i’m glad i did! Amazing phone."
1288,It seems like if I am not in a bigger city there isn’t a signal strong enough to get past 1 bar. The phone I love. Beautiful slim clear but none of that is good if won’t get past a single bar outside of WiFi connection.
1289,The phone works great but took 3 hours to set up but you can switch your card from your old iPhone in and it transfers the service. If you are not super tech savvy I suggest you have someone to help you :)
1290,"I purchased this iPhone XR in a “reconditioned“ state.  After using it a few months now, I’m convinced I was sent a BRAND NEW phone by mistake! Everything works beautifully on it! From facial password recognition to making the little monkey faces that talk, and everything in between; intuitive, user-friendly, with all the bells and whistles that you want an iPhone for! In fact I trust reconditioned products so much after my experience, that I’m buying another one for my son!"
1291,"Phone arrived timely then ,totally crashed during setup.  I contacted Amazon who told me how to resolve the problem.  I returned the phone to vendor as instructed and waited.  While I had been advised that the phone would be reviewed and I would be advised re problem, that didn’t happen, but the phone just popped up one day on my doorstep.  I was somewhat reluctant to attempt setting it up again but all went well and I was very pleased. I’m super happy with this Xr re battery life and functionality.  A big improvement over my old android."
1292,La fuente del cargador no funciona bien
1293,"It came with screen protector and in a durable case. I love this phone. The charging port works, the buttons works and I well satisfied."
1294,Me gustó todo del iPhone!
1295,Came with a few dings and scratches that won’t be seen with a phone case. But all in all was a good purchase. Purchased from Seller  Synergy.
1296,i had it for 1 year and it broke on me like it was malfunctioning on me it would start downloading NSFW  FOR NO REASON i was scared MY 6 YEAR OLD started crying after seeing male PARTS
1297,"Great price , fast shipping. My daughter is happy with “new”phone!  Battery is good, phone as described."
1298,"I bought this phone for my brother. He was happy to receive it from me. I went with him to Verizon to get the phone set up. We did not realize it at the time that the volume buttons does not increase the volume. When he answers the phone, he can barley hear the caller. The only way he can carry on a conversation is to put the phone on speaker or to have bluetooth ear phones. We took the phone to the Geek Squad at Best Buy. They ran a diagnostic and only found the volume buttons issue. They didnt even want to try to fix the phone. I realize one takes a chance when buying renewed but it is still disappointing. I didnt want to bother returning so I told my brother he wil have to live with it for the time being. I will leave it up to you to decide if you even want to make it right as I do not want to try t send it back and my brother not have access to a phone. Thank you."
1299,I ordered the phone on the 8th and it came in today and it works great and the battery health is great
1300,"I was a bit reluctant to order an iPhone replacement from Amazon but decided to give it a shot.  Wow!  This iPhone XR was an excellent purchase.  There were absolutely no screen defects whatsoever and the setup and install went very smooth.  I took the SIM card out of my old iPhone and placed it into this new iPhone and immediately was able to make phone calls.  Even when i logged into my Verizon account, my profile identified this new phone to my phone number.  I would definitely make this purchase again."
1301,For the price I paid it’s a good phone….  Battery goes down fast but overall good.
1302,"I've been pressured into purchasing an iPhone for years by a friend and her daughter. Finally made the switch from my old outdated $27 refurbished Nokia Lumina 640 with Windows OS. The lack of support, updates, and apps available on my old phone made it an easy decision. No complaints here."
1303,Colour: Red (unlocked)I was very skeptical about whether or not I should purchase this phone. But thank God I did. I haven’t had any faults thus far.My battery percentage was at 90%No scratches or wear/ tear.
1304,"Everything seems to work very well. Battery life is a little less than I would wish, but still good. Very satisfied."
1305,The iPhone XR was in great condition and looked brand new. It has no problems.
1306,The phone is like brand new. Still works perfectly almost one year after purchase.
1307,First one came with a cracked back near the camera.Second one came with a scratch on the front screen.I understand these are renewed but c'mon these are simple basic easy to spot QA issues.Will not be ordering a third.
1308,good
1309,This phone is like new. I am so happy with the purchase. All features work. Face recognition works. Battery life is excellent. Very pleased.
1310,"Phone came with some scratches almost imperceptible but the speaker was damaged, in a call I barely can hear the other part, I've changed the speaker at a service provider for about $35.00 and `phone works perfect, so I live in Mexico it would be more expensive exchange the pone paying shipping and taxes than reparation so far now I am happy with the renewed phone. In this case I feel lucky it was a minor defect"
1311,"Me gusto mucho está en muy buen estado , le voy a encargar otro a mi esposo"
1312,"I know that 89% battery capacity isn't that bad, I just wish they actually replaced the battery to get a brand new one. The phone came will a screen protector on it that was well-applied, so that was nice. Everything works prefectly and it was easy to set up, I just had to slide my AT&T chip in it and login to my Apple ID and I was good to go. I would definitely recommend buying refurbished, it's not worth the money for a brand new phone! And I can always replace the battery later for $50 if I need too, although it has been fine so far."
1313,"comes with generic box & charger, charger dont work well.takes time to charge."
1314,Fue una compra que hice para un regalo prácticamente fue un regalo
1315,The only thing is I wish it was bigger but wow what an upgrade from android! I love the collard use a clear case to show it off
1316,"Most of everything about the phone was good. Although, when I got it set up I found out that the mic didn’t work."
1317,"First, it came way sooner than I expected. It really came like 4 days before it said it would which was great cause my phone was on its last legs. Setup was easy, it is Verizon locked which was perfect for me because I have a Verizon SIM card. It came with 92% battery health which is a little less than optimal but it was expected which is why I still give it a 5 star rating. Overall, meets my expectations and works great!"
1318,"I was so hesitant to buy a used phone on amazon.  I’ve always purchased brand new from Apple because I’m so picky about the quality of items.  I decided to take a gamble on this and I’m so glad I did.  The phone is exactly as described, works perfectly and the condition is a solid 9.5 out of 10. The phone I received had very minor marks on the back (which I expected given this is used and the fact Apple uses glass backs now) but they’re barely noticeable even by my picky standards.  The screen is flawless and I’m beyond impressed with this purchase and seller.  The battery health on the phone I received is 96% which way higher than I was expecting it to be"
1319,Works as advertised. Received it much sooner that expected
1320,I tried to add a photo it wouldn’t let me I had a small crack on the side of my phone b it works fine it was renewed and now fully new but I am currently using it to write this review the company was great at conversations with me beautiful color
1321,Excelente estado.
1322,Came is expected in very very good condition.  There are some slight scratches around the camera housing see photo .  But the lens itself seems perfect.  Perhaps the damage came when/if the camera lens was replaced.  The battery health is 91% I would’ve expected/preferred a brand new battery in a refurbished which is how they lost one star.  In all I’m very happy with the purchase.
1323,                    The media could not be loaded.                
1324,"I ordered two of these phones originally about a year ago. The first one had to be replaced because the screen was damaged. The second one had a minor flaw that my husband decided was not worth the hassle we went through to get the first one replaced. (In order to replace it, you have to order a whole new one and then return one.)I’ve had this phone in a case the entire time and only dropped it off the couch onto carpet. The entire back glass is shattered somehow. The back camera and flashlight feature no longer function. The screen lags and battery life on both phones is a struggle. We have to charge our phones 2-3 times a day.It’s a decent phone if you’re on a budget but I definitely wouldn’t recommend it."
1325,I bought this for my son as a present. He upgraded from a IPhone 6 to this XR. I got the unlock version. When we got the phone we only had to do 3 things to get the phone going.1)  had to download and update to a new IOS version.2) Restore from Itunes his data from his old phone3) Had to call MetroPCS to move the sim card to this phone.It all took approximately 45 minutes.So far no problems with the phone. He really loves it.It also arrived earlier than they told us. We were suppose to get it in 7 days.We got it in 5 days.Very please with this purchase.
1326,Quality and Time was great and what I was expecting.
1327,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Guys this is a really great buy the phone basically came brand new. Everything is in tact the face Id works the battery is good could have been better and the screen quality is amazing could not have asked for a better deal.
1328,Arrived in time. Mint condition in Red but after connected phone to test out and found that the speaker on the phone sounded horrible when a call came in or to play music. Hassle of going back and forth to get refund. Didn’t want to go back and forth or wait on refund so took to shop to replace speaker for another $30
1329,The phone came fully unlocked and charged and all I had to do was take it up to my carrier and have them add the sim card plus put it into their system. Same phone number and all my apps came over flawlessly. The only thing I had to set up was the voicemail. You can't tell this phone from a brand new one and the battery life is 5 times my old phone. No imperfections at all! It was delivered a day ahead of time too.
1330,"This is a good phone, however my did not come with a brand new batter so keep that in mind. The battery life is decent but not the super long batter life the IPhone XR is usually known for. I would still recommend getting this phone. It has been doing great and I haven’t had a single problem with it. I’ve had it for 4 months and it is still working flawlessly."
1331,Everything came perfect and fast ordered the phone Wednesday it came Friday 🥰
1332,"This phone came looking brand new!! Absolutely no scratches, 91% battery health, smooth software!! Everything came perfect, I spent all my birthday money on this phone and it was worth it !!"
1333,My daughter loves it she has been wanting one for a long time so far so good only time will tell.
1334,"Quite a solid phone , battery life at 86% so that should last me a year or so, however the only flaw was that only one speaker works, however still 4/5"
1335,Phone is how described however the phone i got has slight screen led problem on bottom left corner.
1336,"When I first got the phone there were small scratches on it. The screen protector that came with it was small. Overall, it’s a good phone."
1337,Muy buen servicio hasta ahora
1338,Phone works well but has several scratches.
1339,"This phone came just as promised. There was one itty bitty scratch, that you wouldn’t notice unless you were just looking for it. The battery lasts SO much longer than my previous 8. The price is very reasonable. So far, I have had no trouble with it. I’ve had it since Wednesday (2/24/2020). The screen quality is also immaculate. I LOVE it. So crisp. The camera is great too. Overall this is a great phone & I would definitely recommend this seller. There was also a free case included with my purchase."
1340,Battery health was really low 80% the bare minimum had a lot of scratches
1341,"Phone was in perfect condition. I wish it came with the regular iPhone headphones, but for the money I don't mind that much."
1342,Muy buenísimo lo recomendado
1343,(New Update)The phone is still working since i got it 2 years ago minus the little problem mentioned previously.(UPDATE SINCE.( Only problem  i found so far is the speaker only muffles and can only hear calls if using a head phoneLove the phone just got mines will update in a month time. One problem i found is that the ringtone doesn’t play out loud so i end up missing calls.still trying to figure out why its doing that. No scratches battery life is 92%.
1344,Loved the face recognition and screen quality it was really nice and useful. Battery could have been better.
1345,I bought it for my grandaughter for her sweet 16 and she loves it!
1346,No damage to the phone. Worked for cricket wireless. Didn’t come charged
1347,Satisfied with phone
1348,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I bought two phones, both came with 100% battery (Yay!) . One of them was in perfect cosmetic condition, while the other, not so much. The block one came with a deep scratch on the back of the phone which is very visible/not visible based on the lighting. It also had small scratches on the corners of the phone. I guess if you get a case and cover it up it doesn't really matter, but I am just slightly disappointed with the inconsistency between the two phones I got. If you are hesitating about buying this, just keep in mind that you are taking a gamble with the cosmetic condition but the phone itself is great! (I bought if from ChubbiesTech btw)"
1349,"My son has been wanting this phone since it came out! He finally got it and he loves it. He's had it for about 6 months now with no issues. The face recognition works good, battery life is good, screen quality is good. It also takes really good pictures and video. This is a renewed phone, but it really looked brand new. We've purchased other renewed phones before that did not look brand new so we were happy about this one."
1350,Screen crystal clear iphone works great love it
1351,"I was scared to order this phone, but I exercised faith to get it. My faith didn’t betray me, it is a big deal and a great phone. 🙏🏼"
1352,The phone was in nice condition unfortunately it quit working after 3 weeks
1353,"I know the idea of a ""renewed"" or ""refurbished"" phone may seem scary to some people. I was really worried before I bought this.  I couldn't believe the deal I got getting this phone and thought it was too good to be true and I'd have to deal with a faulty device. Well, boy was I proven wrong! My phone came fully unlocked as it stated and all I had to do was pop my Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into this iPhone XR and it worked! It started the setup process immediately. All apps work, calling, texting, settings, are working. I am really glad I took a chance on getting this phone to save a couple hundred dollars on a newer model. If you're considering getting this phone, GET IT. You won't be disappointed."
1354,"this iphone Xr is literally amazinggg , the reviews i read were all wrong by a lot , this phone stands out by a lot and it’s absolutely perfect , the response time , the screen resolution , just everything is amazing , don’t think about it just buy it 😍😍. it comes with an adapter , charger , screen protector && a free clear case , and it came within a week without problems , if i were you i would 100% recommend buying this phone without any hesitation 😍❤️. ( brought from chubbiestech)"
1355,It’s a good phone but if you plan on being on FaceTime for 4 hour plus it’s gon lag just a little but every once in a while
1356,"Honestly the phone isn’t bad for a renewed one. Battery Efficiency came at 91% so that’s pretty good. Only thing I found upsetting was the camera quality. The quality on mines wasn’t the best. When you aren’t in good lighting, the pictures have android quality. However, when you have nice lighting or go outside, the lighting looks amazing."
1357,"This is a very good phone. It came pretty fast and was in good shape. It has been working perfectly since I bought it, no issues or complaints at all. The phone is being used outside of the usa and is working fine, so if it’s to gift to someone abroad, don’t worry just make sure you pick the unlocked option at checkout!"
1358,"Battery health came at 89%, decent tho"
1359,The phone was great. It works perfectly fine and seems brand new
1360,"I LOVE IT !!!!! It’s fully unlocked , it’s in immaculate condition, I checked with Apple and it is 100% authentic. I paired it with my Apple Watch with no problems and I’m in love! I would recommend getting a heavy duty case , I’m not really clumsy with my electronics but if you are GET A CASE! Money well spent. Thank you!! It also arrived very early ! Yes it comes with a charger but it is not an apple charger ! It is a brand new knock off but it does it’s job . Also, it came with a mint mobile free trial inside the box . Don’t listen to the bad reviews , get this deal while it lasts!"
1361,Good
1362,"I love the phone! However, I bought the renewed premium and there’s a scratch on the back of the phone and the charger doesn’t work. I payed more but didn’t really get the quality ensured, so I would buy the cheaper renewed one.Edit: I changed the review after contacting product/costumer support. I received a refund for the charger and bought a new charger!"
1363,"At first I was very iffy on buying this product, based on the really bad reviews that were posted, but I took a chance because the majority of the reviews were 5 stars and didn’t have any issues.But I bought this product, and am very happy with it! The only problem that I have with the phone I received, is that it arrived with a bunch of little scratches on the screen. They can’t be seen when the phone is on, but when the screen is off and black, and the light shines on it, you see all the little scratches on the actual screen. I wish that they would have given the phone a new screen before sending it, but the over all function of the device is good."
1364,"Everything works great, came with a phone case and screen protector as well as a charger."
1365,I love this phone it better then the iPhone X I can go a hole day with out charging it
1366,
1367,"The phone came in 2 days and almost brand new! The back and camera are perfect, no scratches at all and there is only a tiny scratch on the front screen (but you barely see it).As far as the battery health: 82%… not great but the overall phone is really good."
1368,"I was very skeptical and was worried after ordering it. Based on some of the reviews it seemed like some people had bad experiences but most of the bad reviews were just nit picking about small details that personally weren’t an issue to me. The phone does come in a generic box as well as with a generic charger and a sim card tool. If you’re willing to look past this then the phone is truly great! For an affordable price my phone is in near perfect condition, battery life is 98% and I had absolutely no issues setting it up with my carrier (MetroPCS). I definitely don’t regret my decision and for less than $500, I can’t complain!"
1369,Works great
1370,"Anyone know which sim card is best for this phone, I have tried several sim cards they are too big or small nothing seem to fit the phone. What sim cards are best for this XR iphone? I am using Straight Talk service."
1371,"My new IPhone XR came in great condition, no scratches and everything works great. The battery though only charges to 90%. This is the same as my other iPhone XR, which I have heavily used for 2 years. No effort was made to improve the used battery, so I am knocking a star off for that but it really was a good purchase otherwise."
1372,"I knew it was chancy, buying used here, but this phone surprised me.  It looks new and works like new. Granted, I have been using an iPhone 7 with a failing battery, but still.  I have been very pleased with this.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the size.  I had not realized that it would bug me to have a bigger phone, but that's my problem.  The phone is pretty awesome.  They even went the extra mile- included a wall plug, aftermarket charger and a phone case."
1373,"Everything works well except it’s hard to hear unless the speakerphone is turned on, even with the volume all the way up. The exterior is in excellent condition."
1374,"I orders this phone on the June 18th. Said it would be delivered June 24th to June 29th and it got here on the 24th. Which is awesome. I love it, it works just like new. It has a fast response times. Yes, there are a few surface scratches but you cannot even tell at all unless you are really trying to find them. Also it had a super tiny chip in the screen cannot tell as well."
1375,"Phone in general is excellent, I had used an Android and like this system and all better for sure. The battery life was a bit disappointing but I had a phone with an xl rating on the battery so I guess this might be the norm. The camera also is a bit on the short end for quality. The reason I still give it a 5 is it is a reworked phone and very impressive at that level."
1376,"I bought this phone for the photo quality, and it delivers."
1377,Excellent quality product
1378,Phone arrived on time. Did not receive an Apple charging cord but cord provided is of good quality and works fine. Battery life is very good. Phone is fully functional and works fine. My only complaint is the screen has several scratches in upper corner which I did not notice right away. My advice would be to check phone screen well before activating.
1379,"I was very worried prior to my phone arriving because I had read some mixed reviews. However, the phone came quick and in decent condition. A few scratches on the screen which are pretty small and battery life is high. Back and outside show minimal signs of usage. Phone works as new."
1380,"Probably the best deal you can get on a newer iPhone. Got mine for around $380! The XR has everything you need and this renewed model looks and works like new. It was a perfect Christmas present for my mother who had an older iPhone 7 with a smaller screen. I wanted something easier for her to read and that had modern features like Face ID. Does not come with an Apple box, but no biggie..we had another one laying around. Comes with an Apple charger, cable  and was charged up already.."
1381,Worked great right out of the box
1382,"Saw the good reviews on this, but when i got it, there were a lot of scuffs and scratches, especially on the bottom right corner as well as on the side of the camera lens in the back. I'd usually be okay with it since i have my case to cover the 4 sides of the phone, but this is a tell-tale sign that the previous owner just didn't take care of this phone and that's an indicator that this phone probably won't last.  I'm coming from the IPhone 6s (which I had for like 5 years) and plan to stay with the XR for years before upgrading.  Battery life was at 91% which wasn't too bad. I'd say it's more like a gamble what you get, so good luck guys. Planning to buy another one with a Grade A or Grade B+ so it 100% won't have this much cosmetic issues. This phone I got was at best a Grade B."
1383,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  So far, its been great. She loves it."
1384,"I bought this iPhone XR for my dad and I was a little apprehensive at buying a refurbished phone because one never knows what you are going to get.  However, I am pleasantly surprised because the phone showed up in great shape and all the functions on the phone work.  If all refurbished phone were like this one I would go that route most of the time to save a little money on the initial purchase."
1385,"There is a problem with the charging, everything was working great until just a few days ago (2 months after I got it) now it only charges when it is shut down and takes like 4-6 hours. I’m going to have to get it fixed :(. But everything else works great"
1386,The screen isn’t flat u can see how it bows in . I cannot put a screen protector on it and it look like it got bubbles in it because the screen is not flat
1387,I love this phone! This is a return to the iPhone world for me from a five year absence. So I’m happy with the iPhone XR as my device of choice. The battery life is great! The color is so beautiful! The touchscreen is great. The durability of the screen is above excellent. I dropped it by accident and it landed face down and didn’t even crack. And it fell pretty hard on a vinyl floor tile so that speaks to its durability. Can’t say enough about this phone.
1388,This phone is ligit.my husband and I have this same exact one we purchased from AT&T on contract.well my sons iPhone 7 needed an upgrade instead of paying full price for an upgrade to renew his plan. I did my research and found this one I took a chance and pooped his soms card in and tada it worked perfectly he loves it it's no different than my own same color performs the same plus it was his Birthday gift so I have a happy 18 year old.will be doing the same soon for my younger daughter when she needs an upgrade.♥️
1389,"I was very hesitant to buy a refurbished phone online and some of the reviews we a little discouraging but this was a great purchase! It came earlier than expected and was indeed fully unlocked (as specified), the phone itself had no cosmetic defaults and the battery life is actually really good( I’m that person that always had my phone plugged in since I use it so often but not anymore!). My husband and mother are now super excited to buy this phone as well!"
1390,Didn’t expect a real working phone. Turns out we actually got one
1391,Product exactly as described. Works great no issues. Delivery on time.
1392,"I like many had their doubts when buying this phone but since my old iPhone 7 was on its last legs, this purchase was worth it. It came quickly two days before it was supposed to come and had a case as an extra which was pretty nice. It works great with my T-Mobile sim and no problems as of this moment. Also has 90% battery health which is pretty good for a renewed phone. Would buy again if needed to buy another phone from these guys"
1393,The phone is great
1394,I would recommend anyone to purchase
1395,Can exactly as advertised. Was a little nervous to buy but very glad I did. 10/10
1396,It is absolutely worth it.
1397,"I-phone XR as represented. Clean, no damage, everything in great working order."
1398,"I know it's a cheap iphone, but it would be better if in the description it says the battery life before people buy it, because my iPhone came with 82% o bl, apple says under 80% battery will have problems, I was looking about some 89% or 90% bl"
1399,"IPhone XR is amazing!!!!!  I ordered it for my daughter for Bday/ Xmas and gave it to her early and she absolutely loves it!!!  She’s19 and said it’s like brand new!!  Seller was the best...  kept in contact with me until it arrived!!!  Do not hesitate to purchase from him!!!  She popped her SIM card from her old Verizon phone, put it in her new iPhone and she was texting in blue immediately!!!  The whole reason she wanted an iPhone???  She felt she was tired of her androids “inferior green texts”!!!!  Maybe she’s a little spoiled...  only child....  she loved the phone...  go ahead and order, you won’t be disappointed!!!  See pics not one scratch on it 😍😍😍"
1400,"So, I bought this product And it came without any scratches or marks on both the screen and the back. Though, later when I was pressing the volume button the phone started glitching badly. I returned this product after contacting the seller. (I got a full refund)Later I bought the same product except from a different seller in hopes that it would be better. Luckily it was crack free with no marks. This phone does not glitch and I’ve been using it normally. Definitely recommend!:)"
1401,I was kind of worried it wouldn’t be a real iPhone it was also my camera was a bit dinged up still good though I think you should buy it
1402,"The phone is in really good physical condition. Only issue was the top speaker being distorted when playing sound. Though it is functional and I am still able to make calls and hear them clearly, it is a slight bummer. I can't really complain as the price of the phone was really good and the seller is giving me a $20 refund. Overall, great buy."
1403,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Had lots of trouble transferring over my data from my last Iphone. However, besides that its a great phone 🤗. If you happen to like this hair i have a business and it is for sale on my business IG @bossupbaddie  And my main IG is @315brooks_  loll."
1404,"My phone works great and I had no issues setting it up on cricket. It has no visible damage externally, but there is a small magenta line in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, only visible when the phone is turned on and displaying a darker color in that area. Definitely not a big deal, does not effect phone function, but slightly distracting until you get used to it.Overall, would definitely recommend this product as a cost-effective way to get a newer iPhone!"
1405,He took my son phone to the wrong house and I was tracking him if my wife wasn't outside they probably would have kept it but my son loves it
1406,My mom loves it
1407,"This was purchased for a gift so I have no experience with it.  But, it did arrive as described in quick fashion."
1408,It was a gift
1409,Excellent product. Great condition and fast delivery  Thank you Guys
1410,"I expected to get a phone with 80% battery life that performed somewhat the way it should. Instead, I got an IPhone XR that performs perfectly and has 100% battery health."
1411,"The phone was in near perfect condition and the batter capacity is at 99%. There are practically no scratches on the phone. It's practically brand new. The problem is the front camera. When I had went to take some pictures with the camera, I had found there to be cracks within the camera, which sucks a lot. I had ordered another phone for my sister, and her camera was just fine. It was amazing even. The rear camera on my phone works well, it's just the front camera that is messed up."
1412,The product is PERFECT! I highly recommend this seller. It delivers what it promises and more. I will go shopping with him again.
1413,We received iPhone was everything we hoped it would be.extremely pleased so far
1414,"The phone was basically good as new. It works perfectly fine. Battery life was on 100. Clean with little to no scratches at all. Overall this was a great deal for a phone. The phone itself is perfect. There is only one minor issue, the phone randomly stops reading my SIM. Other than that the phone is great. Highly recommend"
1415,"Will never buy new again.  Phone is In pristine condition, boxed very nice.  I got a Bibb quality 10ft long braided charging cord (!!).  I bought unlocked specifically for Verizon since Verizon used CDMA bands and I know in the past people have had problems with fully unlocked phones on Verizon  (it’s Verizon’s problem but if you get a full unlocked phone instead of unlocked to Verizon and it doesn’t work you can replace phone ASAP).  Everything works great on phone and the battery was at 96%.  I’m about to go hunt down a renewed iPad Air :)"
1416,"After 24 years of flip phones, then BlackBerry,  then scores of Androids, I've gone over to The Dark side (Apple). Android Auto being as horrific as it is pushed me over to The 🍎.The XR is called the budget X, and I've no comparison to the X or X+. For a refurb(I'm cheap) it's great! Battery life is best I've ever had(48hrs+ with heavy use). I'm still learning the ins and outs of the IOS, and I'm told by many that in a year or so, I'm going to smash it against a wall in a fit of rage. For now I'm happy with it and my new side piece Siri."
1417,"I wasn’t sure about this purchase but the previous reviews were really good from this seller and backed by the 90 Amazon warranty was a great peace of mind. It he price was so much better than a newer model iPhone, so I did make the purchase. It’s great and I’m happy with it. The battery is at 95%! There are some small cosmetic imperfections on the coral color, but there will be a case on it so I’m not concerned. Definitely recommend this seller and quality of the iPhone XR."
1418,Phone was in very good condition. Would definitely buy from again when I need an upgrade.
1419,AMAZZINGGG! I LOVE IT I RECCOMEND BUYING IT !!
1420,"Honestly, I was a bit skeptical when purchasing a renewed unlocked iPhone XR.  Worried it could arrive beat up and not compatible with my SIM card with Straight Talk.  Luckily I was wrong.  If I won’t have know it was a refurbished phone I wouldn’t have any idea and assumed it was a brand new phone.  The phone looked that good!  No scratches, blemishes, nothing!  I simply inserted my SIM card and it instantly connected to Straight Talks towers.  I couldn’t be more happy!"
1421,"Like everyone, I was SUPER nervous to buy some refurbished phone from Amazon. But it was SOOO worth it! The phone came in days before the estimated delivery and was in amazing condition. Mine even came with a glass screen protector! The only damage on the phone is a tiny scratch on the screen, it’s less than it inch small on the corner and barely noticeable. But hey, if I wanted a phone in brand new condition, I would of bought a brand new phone. It came with a charger which is cool. It’s not apple name brand ((which people are mad about for some reason??? Lol okay Karen)) I don’t mind and it works perfect!! So far the battery is great too. This phone is an amazing upgrade from my 6 plus. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this seller !!!!!"
1422,"Can barely hear, volume very low"
1423,Everything seems fine so far.
1424,"Flawless operation and amazing performance, especially when upgrading from 6s. Used magnifying glass to look for scratches and blemishes and found none. The reported battery health is 100%. It is as good as if purchased directly from Apple but for less. I just popped the SIM card in and run data transfer from the old 6s over BT and it was ready to rock. Just FYI, I did elect 'Amazon Renewed' unit to get extra 1 yr. warranty and better quality (according to the Amazon disclaimers and descriptions). I have absolutely no regrets."
1425,"This was a gift for my sister's birthday. Worked like a charm. The only set back was having to catch up the phone on all of the updates but that was resolved and the set up was overall easy to do and manageable. I would definitely buy an Amazon Renewed product in the future. If Amazon is putting their stamp of approval on these types of items, I as the consumer am trusting this company to make sure what I am getting is up to par with the standards I hold this company that I've been using for years. iPhones are not the cheapest phones by a landslide so I expect these bricks to work well even if they are partially used. Great condition overall without any scratches almost new if anything else and arrived in packaging protecting the device."
1426,"This phone arrived in like new condition with all accessories included. Set up and transfer from my older IPhone went quickly. I put in the SIMM card from my old phone and was up and running. My phone slipped and dropped on my kitchen floor. It looked like it chipped the corner of the screen. I found out later, it was just the screen protector that was damaged, the phone was ok. Some 2 piece cases may not fit properly because of the thickness of the screen protector. Not a big deal."
1427,"The phone arrived quickly, was exactly as described. Zero issues getting it setup, great quality and great battery life. Would order again."
1428,Best phone ever.
1429,Both my husband and I have had this phone for about a month now I ordered the yellow he ordered the red iPhone XR and it works perfectly fine! I was so skeptical at first about buying a phone on Amazon but I’m glad I went head and did it! No regrets here! It’s definitely worth buying a phone on here than paying so much more elsewhere. Btw both of our phones came with no scratches! They both were like brand new! We are very pleased for now.
1430,"I purchased for my grandson's 16th birthday. The touch screen and screen quality is awesome! He is constantly showing me the features of his phone. I would like to add that technical support is awesome, not only for a problem, but to help you navigate through the functions of the phone. Don't forget to order your  I-Phone Case and Screen  protective glass, through Amazon, can't beat the prices.  Happy I didn't listen to negative reviews, not a scratch, dent, or broken screen, excellent condition!"
1431,"No scratches no finger prints no cracks on the screen! The iphone XR is great for most purposes, social media, games, and streaming videos, which makes it very convenient. It does indeed have a 1080p resolution screen. After getting to level 19 in hole.io the amount of objects loading and your hole’s size started were what I believe started the temperature of the phone to raise. Battery life is very useful, it can last the whole time your awake (7-14hours) on 50% brightness. In fact, i’m using it right now to write this review. My only real complaint is the price, most iPhones are very expensive, but for the newest model iPhone this is pretty cheap."
1432,it had a little scratch a first but that didn't bother me. the first night I had it started to kinda froze but i had powered it off and the next day it was working fine besides that it has been working perfectly it has a great camera and face recondition seems to be working fine i was scared to buy it cause of all the bad reviews but I'm glad i bought. the battery life compared to my old phone is amazing i only charge it during the night and it lasts me the whole day.
1433,The battery was busted and the phone started cracking.
1434,"Was kind of skeptical at first, kept stalling buying the iPhone because I wasn't sure if buying it brand new directly from Apple would be a smart decision. Really glad I decided to take the plunge.  Came in a timely manner, was in perfect condition. Very tiny discoloration at the corner of the screen but that's negligible, the risk was probable. Got the black one, and was glad I got basically a new one for about $200 less than the brand new price. Hoping that this phone lasts me many more years!!! :)"
1435,"It came without a single scratch on the phone, battery still basically new, and everything works great. There’s some super sketchy sellers on Amazon when it comes to phones, this is a trustworthy one, the 30 point inspection it claims to have received from them is clearly true, since I looked for an hour after getting the phone to find anything wrong and I couldn’t. If you’re on the edge and can’t decide between this seller and any other, I’d go with these guys."
1436,"Came with no scratches, face recognition works great and got here fast! Definitely worth it :)"
1437,Exactly what I expected I love it!!!
1438,This was a gift for my son. It is running just great on Straight Talk service. I would have given a 4.5 if I could. He loves it! Only downfall was no tool to open the sim card tray with. But good old paperclips are still useful for something!
1439,"The product fits the description, and is even better than I expected it to be. The battery is great and the phone is brand new. The reason I gave it a four star rating is because no matter which iPhone you purchase, give any piece of technology a few years and of course it will get worn out, however the first thing to drastically break down is always the battery, and Apple is not all that great when it comes to its batteries."
1440,"Very good bang for the buck. It comes with great battery life, is like new with only a few minor scratches. The only drawback that I am currently having is low audio notices, the volume is low for some odd reason. I don't know is it that all the phone are like mine or is it just my unit. I'm OK with it tho."
1441,El telefono esta calidad la batería vino con %98 y bien en buen estado 👌
1442,The battery life and facial recognition works perfect. The storage capacity is really good for me because it’s not too much and it’s not too less.
1443,"This phone came earlier than expected which made me happy, it came with amazing conditions. The battery health came at 96% which i did not expect, i probably just got lucky. No scratches at all which is amazing. Once I bought it, I started having regrets but it came all good. 100% recommended."
1444,"Product photo showed original apple iPhone charger and apple earbuds+adapter which is misleading . It did not come with an authentic apple charger it came with a generic one , and the earbuds+adapter were not included either.The phone works great and looks great though."
1445,Worth the buy
1446,The phone came faster than I expected. In great condition! Screen quality is normal!
1447,Turned out to be a great phone. It works and looks good.
1448,Good purchase looks new never a problem my daughter loves the phone
1449,Had to many scratches
1450,"I wasn't expecting much because of some of the more critical reviews but, there's not a scratch on this thing and the battery life is at 87% which is pretty decent for the price. I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality and content with my purchase :)"
1451,The battery life was 99% and I’ve had this phone for about a year now. Face recognition was also great.
1452,Not unlocked correctly
1453,"Was very skeptical but it all turned out alright ! If you’re contemplating getting this , go ahead ... I just got my Iphone XR today and everything is good so far .... The phone came in without a scratch or crack ... the seller sent in a charger as well ... it looked brand new tbh ... I absolutely love the color and the camera ... will keep you guys updated if anything occurs .. Just so you know , I ordered from the seller “Chubbies Tech” cause I’ve seen many phones with these same reviews which confused me ...."
1454,"Let me start by saying I ordered my iPhone XR in April. Unfortunately, at the beginning of June my phone had an issue. This is usually where you would stop reading a review.However, this has been some of the best customer service I have had as long as I’ve been using Amazon. They were quick to respond, they were quick to address my issues, and they sent me a brand new phone for NO charge. I would highly suggest buying a phone from this company, my new phone works beautifully there is no external damages and I have not had any issues with my new phone."
1455,Volume is not effective. Should have disclosed this information before selling.
1456,I love the phone it comes with a screen protector and charger. My only complaint is that there was no SIM card included which seemed odd. It wasn’t a problem because I had one but thought that it might be helpful to know if you are changing from another brand to apple. But the phone is just what I was hoping for and is not a scam.
1457,I got this phone on here. My daughter still has it til this day. Love the price 😍 of this phone. I would buy another phone off Amazon again
1458,"The phone came in almost mint condition, just a couple super tiny details that indicated it wasn't brand new. The setup went fine and when checking the functionality, everything seemed to work as indicated. When buying these phones you're guaranteed 80%-100% battery health, mine was in the middle at 91%. Wish it was higher but what can you do at the price you're paying for it."
1459,"This phone is perfect. No cracks, dents, or scratches. Battery life is great."
1460,The phone works well and arrived quickly.  The only two minor issues are that the speakers were not cleaned well (there is visible dirt) and the paint around the camera is chipped and it is visible from far away.  (According to amazons renewed phone policies the phones should be thoroughly cleaned and not have any visible scratches from arms length).
1461,I’ve had for 3 months now and it runs perfectly. Literally no different from buying a phone first hand. It was also delivered very quickly!
1462,"This is a great phone, the only thing is that it does come with some scratches but with a screen protector they are not even noticeable the battery life is as good as any other phone if you're on it all day it will die if not it lives idk it is just a phone not over priced at all. Also the charging box it comes with is not trust worthy it was sparking anytime i tried to plug it into the wall."
1463,"As some other people I was a little skeptical ordering a ""renewed"" phone from an unknown seller, but it was great. Fast 2 day shipping, and phone arrived in great shape. Phone itself had a few very very  minor light scratches that can only be seen if u inspect it very closely. Cant notice them with a glass screen protector on. No other dents dings or scratches anywhere. Phone is valid and official, in fact there is 6 month factory warranty left on the phone. Battery life is great, lasted 2 days of normal use which is incredible.  Phone was unlocked as advertised, and worked with my Cricket sim no problem. Charges quickly, very fast phone. Great phone and purchase overall!!"
1464,The product arrived on time. It was as advertised . The only thing I didn't like like was that it didn't come with an apple brand chargerOtherwise great product
1465,It is too slick for my hand. I’ve dropped it at least four times. Thankfully it has not broken. I don’t think a glass back was a good idea. My finger aren’t very long.
1466,I hesitated to buy it at first because of the bad reviews but when I finally got the phone I really liked it. It took two days for me to receive it after it was shipped. I ordered the XR in coral. The battery life was 99% which is more than perfect for me. The seller I bought from was promo dealz and I really love the phone so far.
1467,The price was very good and it is like new condition.  Good battery life and very fast/responsive - great Christmas present for my wife.
1468,"I was pleasantly surprised when the phone arrived before the promised delivery date. However, the phone was uncleaned. It had dirt and grim built up around the camera lenses, buttons, and speakers along with some very minor cosmetic scratches. It took a bit of time to clean as much of the dirt I could. Not all of was removed the speaker area especially."
1469,"I was hesitating to buy this phone because I knew I might get scammed but so far it seems legit. The phone is pretty much brand new, you can tell it was used but there aren’t any scratches or cracks on the screen and everything is working how it should! It even came with a free case :)edit:I’ve had this phone for about a year now and it still works great! If you’re hesitating to buy this is your sign to do it."
1470,"Battery life @ 91%.Scuff/Paint chip on charging port.Good quality phone, awesome for that price.Phone is in excellent working condition.Would have loved a cleaner / less used phone as it’s advertised as “renewed” not “used”. Overall great choice for an iphone with IOS 11or higher. Great size. Love it!"
1471,I received the iPhone very early it works perfect and it looks new ! Everything works and no problem switching my old iPhone to this one. I was a little nervous when I ordered it but I was worth it.
1472,"I’m always quite behind in modern electronics, but due to circumstances recently decided to upgrade from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone XR. I couldn’t be more pleased with the phone, but also simply cannot believe that it is not new! This phone is in immaculate condition, without a single scuff or scratch anywhere on it. The seller even professionally installed a screen protector without a single air bubble and it is lined up absolutely perfectly. Thank you very much!"
1473,"I was very very very skeptical about this phone because of the reviews , and I’m and android user switching to team iPhone...but I can say the phone looked brand new , no scratch , no cracks , nothing . My boyfriend was highly impressed ! It was as simple as popping my SIM card in and that’s it . Came with a apple charger , i seen a lot of people saying they got Android charger & a screen protector"
1474,Great quality! Super reliable and got shipped to me even earlier than I expected.
1475,Uso personalDesbloqueado totalmente
1476,"Everything I asked for. This product is exactly how it was advertised. There are no scratches and the phone looks brand new as well as runs perfectly. It even arrived early. Didn’t rate all five stars because there is always room for improvement. All in all I would definitely recommend buying this if you are searching for a used iPhone that is under a thousand dollars. I was a bit worried that the price was a little sketchy considering the newer iPhone cost the same amount as multiple car payments, I was proved wrong."
1477,The phone is great . Works fine but for some reason my messages disappear with certain conversations.
1478,The back of the phone was broke when I received it
1479,Product worked as expected. So far no negative experience to report except for poor data reception. No sure if this is a carrier issue.
1480,The phone was so good no screen  Scratches it works fantastic I love it!!!
1481,"Phone is at good battery health 89%, minor scratches by the camera but overall good phone"
1482,"Buen producto, llego en menos del tiempo indicado. Tal cual como indica la descripción. Lo envié a Venezuela y funcionó perfecto."
1483,I would give it 5 stars but I bought this phone for my husband because his sound on a call only worked on speaker I bought this phone and it had the same issues so it was upsetting.
1484,
1485,I’m impressed!!!!
1486,Very fast shipping and the product is like new
1487,Battery health was at 90% upon arrival. But overall been a great phone.
1488,Got for my daughter for Christmas great phone
1489,"My daughter loves her phone . It look brand new no issues at all . Will buy from seller againUpdate we purchased another phone for my daughter 1/6/2021  with this company iPhone XR looks brand new came the very next day 1/7/2021  after ordering no issues everything looks good came with charge, phone case screen protector nice right ?  will buy again from this seller .This is the 3rd time I ordered this phone from this seller same color same model 3/6/21 IT DID HAVE A FEW DENTS WHICH WASNT EXPECTED BUT OVERALL IT WAS GOOD . Will buy from seller again. Ships really fast***Not paid to write reviews ***"
1490,It came in a super good condition but the only problem I have is that there’s times that the screen is unable to detect my touch and it lags but other then that it’s alright.
1491,"We ordered this renewed iphone XR and weren't sure what to expect based on a few of the reviews.  However, the phone we received is excellent, like new, with great battery life, could not be happier with it.  Ours came from electro wireless. It was packaged great with a new charger and cord.  Thanks"
1492,Excellent and fast device but the color is not suitable for me
1493,"Lo compré con renawed premium y llegó excelente, face id 100% funcional y el aspecto del teléfono como nuevo"
1494,"This phone is basically brand new, only problem is with the sound but it’s not a huge problem! Will be buying again!"
1495,
1496,"I was hesitant after the reviews but I decided to chance it! AND IM SO GLAD I DID! The phone is gorgeous (I got product red) works well. However I did have a hard time getting it working because my old number wouldn’t transfer (I use straight talk) and had to get a bring your own phone plan, and had to talk to customer service to get it activated which wasn’t Amazon’s fault. But if you have the same problem which I read a few reviews did. Just do what I did! Best purchase ever! THANKS AMAZON!"
1497,Phone came very fast. Came with couple scratches not bad. Face recognition works just fine. I realized that on some apps the screen acts up a bit. So far it’s okay but I’m watching it hoping it’s great. Seller is great and reliable.
1498,Muy cuidado y sin rasguños. Buena calidad
1499,"Not scratched or cracked.  Looks really good.  Battery life guaranteed greater than 80% (was 90% after got XR charged and up and running).  That is reason I rated battery life at 4 stars.  It was as advertised, BUT with a purchase of this price, I am grading it based on value and I really wanted at least 95%.  Paying for 'renewed premium' would only guaranteed 90% minimum though.  For a 'renewed' product, happy with purchase, but this is only day two of use :)"
1500,The phone was as expected for a few months.  Then it started randomly shutting off.  After 5 months it would shut off very frequently.  Now it shuts off when you try to open any app.I will say that it arrived promptly.I’ll update review if anything changes.
1501,"Love this phone! I made the switch from an android device to this iPhone XR and the difference in camera quality and speed is quite substantial. Although, the phone came with one broken speaker grill at the bottom, a missing screw next to the charger port, and a quite noticeable scratch on the top left of the phone, these complications did not effect my every day usage. So far I have been able to use the phone without any problems."
1502,I like to take a little time when I review something like a phone. I’ve had it for a couple months and I love it. I definitely had to make a decision between a more expensive iPhone in this one. But if I would’ve had the chance to use this one the decision would have been easy. This phone is capable of anything that the 10 XS is Basically. End it has an a impeccable battery life! It’s battery life goes head-to-head with that of the 11. And this song came out before the 11th so I definitely told you something. I will recommend this phone for anyone. Also has a pretty great camera. And currently it’s pretty fast.
1503,"Very surprised when received.  The iPhone XR looked brand new.  No signs of use anywhere on the phone.  Battery life maximum capacity is 92% which was comparable to my old iPhone.  The price was great as well.  While it comes with no SIM card, I was able to pull the SIM card from my old phone and use it in this one.  The data easily transferrred and within a hour or so I was up and running on the new phone!!!"
1504,"The only noticeable problem with the phone I ordered is the liquid mark under the screen. Other than that, it’s solidI would recommend but you will more than likely have one or two things wrong with the phone when you get it"
1505,"It’s an awesome phone, even though it took over two weeks to get here, which isn’t the sellers fault, it was just annoying. There were no screen defects, or any scuffs anywhere that I could see. The max battery life is decent enough and it came with a free case, which isn’t the one in the pictures but it is a clear case and it’s super good quality, and it also came with a screen protector. I’d 100% recommend buying from chubbiestech."
1506,The phone came in excellent condition. The battery life is at 93% . It was 2 day shipping and my son love it!
1507,"this product that I receive is amazing! I am so happy that I have got this phone because I've worked for this phone for quite some time now and for the fact that I actually got it, it's great! This phone has absolutely no scratches no dent marks it came with a charger but no headphones sadly. But it's OK though because I already have some headphones. The battery life was kind of low, but I get why it was low though. I don't know why I see all kinds of replies about this product being bad but it really isn't though. It take time for it to arrive but it is worth the wait!"
1508,"I ordered & received an iPhone 11XR, however, the ESN was bad. Once Techmint received my return, Adam w/ Techmint Management made sure my money was returned. Thank you!!"
1509,The phone is used don’t get it
1510,"The phone came in with  screen protector, but it had a big scratch in the middle of the real screen, it doesn’t have a single dent or scratch other than that, the phone looks brand new battery came in at 89% I did not like that it came with that percentage"
1511,"I’ve never bought a phone online and the screen quality of the phone is great, Battery life is great just no face recognition."
1512,I always had a smaller phone. Just have to get used to carrying a bigger phone around
1513,"Edit: unfortunately I've had to send the phone back as it seems to be having battery issues. The battery indicator would sometimes not update when charging and sometimes seem stuck until I restarted the phone. Sigh, oh well.I was a bit skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but I decided to give it a try. My phone came from the seller Chubbiestech.The box contained the phone, a lightning cable, a charger and a sim eject tool. The phone also came with a glass screen protector already installed.Pulling the phone out of the little clear plastic bag and looking over it carefully, it was flawless, no scratches, scuffs or anything it looked very much new.After I set the phone up I decided to check the battery health and capacity as in the description for the amazon refurbished phones ,it says the battery health may be around 80%. Well to my surprise this one showed the battery at 100% capacity so yeah this phone is practically new.So if you’re thinking of buying one give it a shot."
1514,I like the phone but the description is misleading because there is not enough information about the specifications as for as functional everything else has been awesome if knew it wasn’t dual sim I wouldn’t have purchased it I didn’t return it because I was leaving the country I wanted to use a Dominican sim and a USA sim to eliminate a device no problems whatsoever ever with th the device but it this version does not have dual sim slot it will work internationally I gave two stars for the lack of information in the description
1515,This is a great first time phone for a teenagers. Works great and looks amazing. Very happy with the phone.
1516,"Just received my phone today, so far so good! I was very happy with the condition of the phone, looks brand new, other than a small scratch at the top right corner, I had to look hard to find. Came with a screen protector, clear case, and the standard charging equipment. As long as the phone stays in good working order (I’ve been using it all day) I will be 100% satisfied! Also, it shipped quick and arrived a day early!"
1517,The fact that it is broken I don’t want a broken phone
1518,Phone came just as advertised
1519,It arrived fast as you would expect from Amazon. The phone feels good holding it and it responds fast to the touch. So far I'm very happy with it.
1520,Equipo en muy buenas condiciones físicas y muy buen funcionamiento
1521,This phone IS SO GOOD. I was so afriad of getting it but it works so good.
1522,"My phone had some scuff marks on the frame and a tiny scratch on the screen. Surprisingly, it had 97% battery health which I did not expect for a 2-year old device. Pretty happy with the purchase."
1523,"I was a little skeptical about buying this phone because of the negative reviews I saw. But I ended up making the decision to do so. The phone is great, came fully unlocked. I have metropcs and I had to go to a metro store for them to help me switch to this phone. The fee to switch at metro was $21.88. The phone came faster then expected and is in great condition. Face ID works fine and the IOS 14 update was great. Don’t be scared by negative reviews, this phone is nice"
1524,"I was really scared to order a device because you never know what you could get. Although, I love that it allowed a 90 day warranty!I got the Yellow XR & it is in perfect condition with 90% battery health. Perfect!Love the camera quality, Face ID, and the size of the screen.Definitely recommend.Comes with a charger and a pin to take the sim out"
1525,Great experience. Everything works just fine.
1526,I liked everything the iPhone is great and I’m also doing my part to recycle
1527,It was delivered on time and it was great. It was as a gift and they loved it
1528,Delivered as advertised.  The screen on this model is not that good.  Not a very high resolution.
1529,"Perfect, as advertised, with good screen protector already applied. Which is good, since I've already dropped it twice! (I had forgotten how slippery an iPhone is without a case!) In conclusion, order your case at the same time as the phone."
1530,I got the phone and this was what the battery life was at. Other than that it is a very good phone
1531,THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW!! Soooo I’m surprised. First of all I I ordered this phone on Monday. It’s Thursday. I’m typing this on the phone now. I was so scared to buy this phone off amazon because of some of the reviews but I’m so glad that I did. It’s totally unlocked As I’ve already switched it over to my phone company. Screen is in pristine condition as is the back glass of the phone. Battery is at 94% health wise. Came with a charger with no headphones but the description also tells you that. It’s otherwise a great phone. I love it. Great phone for a great price!!!!!
1532,I have my doubts about “refurbished” technology however the price is paid for new.  Given value I put my confidence in Amazon and am not disappointed. The iPhone is like new (maybe even new) and is fully functional! Moving from an iPhone 8 Plus to the XR was not a big jump….  The packaging is professional and well done - quality & value exudes.
1533,The product arrived just as described with very minimal scratch barely noticeable. Phone works just as it should. The delivery was on time. The phone was fully unlocked and I was able to use it with my carrier without any issues thus far. I recommend the seller fully.
1534,"This experience was so much better than I anticipated. The iPhone I was sent looks like it’s brand new. Not a single blemish on this device anywhere. No Apple ID activation lock issues and zero display or processor lag. Device is quite fast. The battery maximum capacity is 91% which is fairly normal for a phone with an original date of purchase March, 2019. All sensors and features work. Very happy with this experience and the quality received. HIGHLY recommend. Thank you for a perfect phone."
1535,"My daughter really wanted a coral colored IPhone XR for Xmas so I came across this site. I was so skeptic of this and nervous at the same time that this would be a bad idea... but it wasn’t. The phone was in absolute great condition when I received it, not a scratch one. It also came in a nice plain white box with a charger included. I was so shocked that this phone was so brand new looking. On Xmas when she opened her phone she put her SIM card in it from her previous iPhone and she didn’t have any problems with that. She’s only had this phone for a couple of weeks now but so far so good. Highly recommend!!"
1536,"Perfect phone - no noticeable defects, battery life is great, and it was easy to set up."
1537,Ived had the phone for two days no problems so far. It came in good condition no scratches. I bought the unlcoked for all carriers. Im from The Bahamams and it works fine in my country. It did not come with headphones but it did come with a charger and sim removal tool. So far so good!!
1538,Phone is okay. From day one it would heat up some. Decided to try and live with that. But it can never load web pages on data nor connect to Bluetooth.
1539,"I’d rate this phone 3.5 stars. Overall, I cannot complain.  It functions properly. Battery life is at 99%. There are mild scratches on the side and back of the phone (more than what I have on my iPhone 7, but I’m particular with my stuff). It came with a generic charger and was in a standard box, not an apple one. There is mild-moderate dirt/lint in the cracks/crevices/speaker cover. It came with a screen protector installed, which was unfortunately installed a little off-center. It does not appear this phone was disassembled and fully refurbished. It appears to be a used phone. Would I buy another one?  I’m not sure. I’d highly consider buying a brand new one from Apple for $180 more, that way you know exactly what you’re getting.  However, if you just need a phone and are ok with minor cosmetic blemishes, this could be a way to save a little money over a new phone."
1540,The phone was fine and wasn’t surprised that is wasn’t in perfect condition. Screen was a bit scratched in one area (but looks great with a screen protector on it now) and the phone camera lens housing paint was rubbed off; probably from being used without a case.
1541,Came on time in perfect condition.  My son loves it. We connected it to our MetroPCS and it works great. The only problem with connecting it to my MetroPCS account was the newbie working at MetroPCS.  But that has nothing to do with Amazon or the seller.  I am very happy with my phone and will be ordering from the same seller for my younger sons 8th grade graduation this summer.
1542,Looks new works really well.
1543,Abcdefg
1544,"So I ordered 2 red iPhones & when they came in one of em had scratches all over tha screen then tha other one has a deep scratch in tha back of it. So I go to connect them & tha one with tha scratch on tha back was able to get turned on but turns out tha other one was black listed. Tha one I ended up keeping is a good phone , only thing I’m disappointed in is that it has a big deep scratch on tha back when they advertise that these phones are like new .. & I’m disappointed that tha other one was black listed & they weren’t able to send me a replacement 🙄😒 but I guess they say they’re sending me a refund so we’ll see ...Guess what im tryna say is , good luck hopefully u get a great phone like these other reviews say."
1545,Got this used phone and it’s in perfect condition. It was unlocked as described and the phone was already factory reset
1546,"For a refurbished iPhone, when I received it, it might as well have been brand new. There were like 2 tiny tiny scuffs but that was it and who cares. The front camera though won’t work and I have to reset the phone but that’s about it. Everything else works great and I had 98% battery health which is amazing. This was well worth the money vs buying a new XREdit 23 Nov 2020The camera issue has been resolved since this was posted. It seemed to resolve on its own after about a month of using the phone. It still works amazing."
1547,This iphone serves its purpose and better.  Hoping it will last also.
1548,"Phone works, but since it’s “refurbished” and they don’t specify the details of its condition, the item could range from no visible damage to clearly visible dents and scratches"
1549,"This is a legit, renewed phone. However, it could certainly be the case that I just got lucky. I cannot attest for the people who have received faulty products, but I can attest for my own product. I got a fully unlocked, renewed iPhone XR that has 93% of its original battery capacity. Everything in it works, and it charges normally. I would say it's worth it, and even by the slim chance you get a faulty product, amazon is always good handling returns and refunds."
1550,The phone was replacement phone
1551,The screen protector was shattered when we received it.
1552,"This seller was the best. I ordered another iphone from someone else and that was a mistake. First, the iphone from this seller was as described. Clean, looking like new, ramped very well. Second, fast shipping the phone was received two days later. This phone was for my wife and she loved it... So today I ordered another iphone from this seller."
1553,"Phone works well and looks good. Even came with a glass screen protector. Been using it for a week and no issues. Only blemish is a finger tip size area of scratches on the screen. Not a big deal, but they’re there."
1554,"As a rule of thumb I never buy anything refurbished. This was the one exception,because I could not afford a new iphone XR. I took a risk and paid for it. The refurbished iphone xr the screen was full of scratches. The speakers sounded like they were blown, and watching live streaming vidoe is very choppy. I would not reccomend to anyone to buy a renewed or refurbished item. You just dont know what problems your getting that someone didnt want. Sadly I cannot return this item for a refund. So I am out $262 dollars plus an additional $55 dollars that I had to spent to get a new sim card and activiate the phone. Not a happy customer"
1555,"This phone is absolutely stunning! Not a scratch or dent or scuff or ding! Absolutely beautiful. Have not turned it on yet. I wrapped it for a present for my daughter. Will update on how it functions on Dec. 25th.Okay, it is now one month of using the phone. This phone is excellent. Just like BRAND NEW!! SERIOUSLY! NO DIFFRENCE! I can't believe I was able to get a phone in new condition for half the price of a store bought phone. Definately recommend!"
1556,Outstanding phone for price....
1557,"It took longer than expected to ship, but when it finally shipped I could not be happier! I have had for it for about 5 days and haven’t experienced any glitches or any problems. I was super nervous with the reviews but I’m so glad I went with my gut! I got the coral iPhone XR from Kenga and it’s so great. Customer service was also so sweet!"
1558,Battery life
1559,Wax s hood purchase.
1560,No real battery life you have to charge the phone too much. Cannot transfers all my photos and videos lot important saved videos of my 2019 deceased mother and her last voice mail so I’m very disappointed you charged to much money I would return this phone if it weren’t a gift . I will never buy a phone from you again I will let people kno about this false advertisement.
1561,My son loves this phone. The battery last longer and picture quality is the best it's ever been. Even though we had to switch cell providers because it wasn't compatible with the old provider I have to say it was well worth it.
1562,I went through probably all of the reviews and a switch between sellers a lot.! But I am happy with my iPhone XR RED.I ordered mine through QD ELECTRONICS. Which I think is useful to know because you can never tell which seller is selling the more quality phone if no one mentions the seller.Only negative was how the phone was packaged in the box didn’t seem like it was protective enough. Although my phone was on a plane and a long car ride to get here so maybe it’s fine.
1563,"I bought this fory daughter to use on MetroPCS. We received it quickly and well packaged. It included the original box and charger. It was in perfect condition, no cracks or marked. Powered right up and we were able to log in. For $15 Metro swapped her number and she was good to go. She loves the phone which does take great pics! Battery life seems good, screen colors pop and it's able to multitask with lag time. This phone cost over $100 more at the Metro store and they didn't offer yellow. I would definitely purchase another phone from this company. My teen daughter loves the larger screen, picture taking quality and filters, and facial recognition. This purchase was definitely a success."
1564,Such a great deal for a great phone! Buy it! Mine came with a screen protector and a case too! 100% recommended! Only con is that the battery health is 89% and this is what Amazon said it would be around. Great phone
1565,Just one dent at the charging port but overall no problem at all
1566,"It came on time. Looks brand new. No problems so far. So far excellent buy, I’ll buy again from buyer.If anything goes wrong I’ll update. But I am honestly satisfied. I read the reviews to and it had me Skeptical about buying. But once I seen people that felt the same way I did take a chance and they stated the were satisfied. It Eased my mind a little and I’m am happy i took a chance with seller."
1567,"the battery health is at 89 out of the box, was hoping for more. but overall no cracks, scratches, everything else is in perfect condition!"
1568,Like how everything so fast and smooth with the phone and came with no bugs with it also because the last phone I had bought off here they had gave me a messed up speaker and I tested the speaker on this phone all the time with everything else and it just perfect. And also it came with a screen protector so I was very very happy with that. Five stars.
1569,"It’s refurbished so I was not expecting perfection , the phone itself came looking beautiful only defect was the red paint around the camera lens was chipping away but the rest of the phone was perfect . However the charger it came with did not work at all so I had to order a new one . Not good 👎🏽 Also the screen glitches a lot . It will touch things /type when my finger is not even on the screen and sometimes too when I touch the screen it doesn’t work , I will have to click it off and on again for it to move . It works for the most part and the camera is ok but probably if you want an iPhone just go buy a new one"
1570,"It’s a good phone, had a little scratch around the camera and a little white dot in the middle of the phone. Battery percent was at 89% so overall a good go home with minor issues. Didn’t come with headphones or the original apple box."
1571,I say this because I only buy my phones on amazon unlocked (and typically refurbished) so already paying less than full price for full quality. My phone functions the same as others who’ve bought directly from the Apple store and it’s been almost two years! Buy and don’t hesitate
1572,Phone looked practically new when it arrived. Battery health was I think 96% or something close. It's been a almost a year now and phone has functioned with no issues even with intensive everyday gaming and everything still works as new (battery health now 88%). Only complaint is the cheap non-oem charging brick and chord it came with but otherwise very pleased with this purchase. My seller was Chubbiestech.
1573,This is so goo I have been using this for an day now and it comes with 100% battery life and it’s very good camera quality is 100% legit also it came with no scratches it was like an brands new phone! UPDATE it came with a screen protector and I don’t even know!
1574,The only thing I dislike about the phone is what it was delivered in. I expected an apple box and an apple charger but instead I got an off brand charger that’s 2 or 3 feet long and a plain white box. It also didn’t come with earbuds.
1575,"I was in need of an upgrade but didn’t want to lease and couldn’t afford the price of something brand new so I took a shot on this.  Probably the best “refurbished” items I’ve ever bought.  I used refurb in quotes because this thing was mint.... looks and functions brand new.  I mean honestly, not a thing wrong!  Battery life was at 100%, screen quality is perfect.  Couldn’t be happier with this phone!"
1576,Un parlante no me funciona y la batería llegó en 92%. Pero todo lo demás está excelente
1577,Phone looks and works like new.  No issues at all.  Battery has 97% life - even better than promised.
1578,"Phone looked brand new, was super clean and ready to rock. Unfortunately unlocked phones do not work with Boost Mobile only Boost Mobile devices will work on their network in the USA. Perhaps seller doesn't know this but may consider adding to description. I tried repeatedly to plug-in the IMEI on Boost's website and it kept spitting out an error message. After calling support— they said they could not swap me to this device. Oh well."
1579,"Good phone ... OK value for re-furbished ... Found it available ""brand new"" for only $ 25.00 more than my purchase price ... Re-furbished should be a bit more competitively priced.  But ... a nice phone for sure ..."
1580,The phone is working great as a new phone
1581,"LOVE  LOVE LOVE the item no scratch, finger prints could have been found. Item was basically brand new like it came just out Apple. Take really nice photos too. I basically wanted an upgrade and the XR was perfect dont need those other big chunky phones to tote around give me the XR any day. I just need to upgrade my icloud and all stil was well."
1582,"The only minor issue it was just one small scratch near the speaker, but the battery life was better than expected 90%. Phone came with a charger but it stopped working after one day.Customer service 10/10, during the time of my order New York had a snow storm I was informed and updated about my order until it arrived. I am very satisfied would shop again !"
1583,Me llego con la batería al 95%
1584,Phone arrived arrived on date expected in quality packaging.  So far the battery is holding up for the entire day and the touch screen is responding perfectly.  There are just a couple of minor scratches on the body so nearly new condition as far as I’m concerned! I’m very leased with my purchase.
1585,                    The media could not be loaded.                 The phone came in perfect condition with a charger and headphones and everything. I honestly couldn't even tell it had been used! I am so glad that I bought this and I would 150% recommend this for anyone who is looking for a really good phone but for cheaper. IT IS PERFECT AND I LOVE IT
1586,"This Phone is Amazing, i order it November 10 and  it said Arriving the 18th, but came November 14, im so happy , I purchased it from Maverick Wireless and I want to say i was very nervous about purchasing an refurbished iphone for only $373 but its amazing, The Camera is amazing, Screen is brand new and they'll put a screen protector on for you also the packaging was great it came with the actul iphone box port ans iphone charger, so happy with my purchase."
1587,Contenta con el producto! Un rayoncito en la parte de atrás muy mínima. En excelente estado casi como nuevo !
1588,"Ya know, it’s a major upgrade from what I had and was in solid shape. Would’ve given 5 starts but there was light wear and tear and the battery life was 92% (which is pretty good). I would def recommend this route for anyone who doesn’t want to break the bank on a nice phone."
1589,Phone looks brand new. I will buy from seller again
1590,It is amazing
1591,I’m satisfied and I recommend this seller
1592,Works fine
1593,I’m not going to lie I was skeptical of buying a refurbished phone but I was promised 90 days to figure out if I wanted a refund for it. It has been a couple of weeks and I can say I will be keeping it. The battery health was 100% when it arrived and it had no scratches or damages plus they included a screen protector. It did come with a charger but it was not an apple charger. If you’re on the fence about buying a refurbished product I say go for it and return it if you find defects.
1594,"I received the with a few scratches on the screen.  Most were light but one was particularly bothersome.  I decided to keep it anyway.  The seller contacted me and bent over backwards to make me happy.  Ultimately I decided to keep it anyway.  The purchase is risk free as you can exchange or return it and i'm sure this was just an oversight.  The seller is also very customer oriented, so you can be confident they will make it right if there is an issue."
1595,"There is so much to know about this phone and it works so good when you know what to do.  Customer service was great.  Being a senior citizen, I didn’t grow up with the technology but I am determined to make the best possible use of this multi-faceted unit. It was easy to set up, screen prompts  are very clear."
1596,"Cuando lo compré el anuncio decía que se garantizaba mínimo el 80% de vida útil de la batería, y cargándola completa sin usarlo constantemente solo dura unas 9 horas, tengo otro exactamente igual y lo recargo cada dos (2) días, el cable incluido tampoco no funciono."
1597,"The phone is very glitchy and when we brought it to an Apple authorized dealer, we were told that it needs a new screen; that the one that is on the phone is not an Apple one and something about missing ribbons - these things are what is causing the problems with the phone.  I would not purchase from this seller again.Note - Updated review - while we had the problem discussed above with the phone we purchased when we notified the seller of the problem they sent a FedEx call tag for returning the phone freight prepaid & the credit for the purchase price was credited back a few days after we sent the defective phone back."
1598,"Well I am a teenager and I was skeptical about buying this phone because I saved up for about 1 and half months from my first job, but it is save to say that it’s not bad at all, when I revived the phone there were some scratches on the screen, and couple of chips on the side of the phone but nothing major, and on the back there was some scratches, but nothing to major, over all I would recommend to buy this phone"
1599,would most definitely recommend
1600,I love my new phone. I am going from an iPhone rosegold 6S to a white XR.  It's a pretty big jump.  I have only had it for 5 days but it works great. No scratches or marks on the phone.  The maximum battery is 93% which is fine (I new it be at least 80%)  There is nothing I dislike at this time.  I bought my 6S (had it for 2.5 years) on Amazon and had such a good experience I got the XR on Amazon.  It is a much more affordable way to buy a phone.
1601,"The phone arrived just as described..like new. I love the long battery life, camera, superior picture quality and many other feature upgrades from my older iphone. Many expanded customizable options that you will love!!!"
1602,"Certainly doesn’t look like new! Received a dirty phone with grime on the edges, in the speaker and other nooks and crannies. Has a scratch on the Screen and small Little paint Chip. Will return. I expected a clean product since it was advertised as „looks and works like new“. It seems to work and shipping was fast that’s why I gave it three stars."
1603,"It’s a refurb, don’t Expect 100% capacity battery and to get OEM batteries from Apple becomes very expensive so other than that these phones are brand new one time I received a phone from another company on here it was a 7 not an Xr and it had admin lock on it that has deterred me for so long but I took a leap of faith her and paid for this much cooler much newer also much more expensive xr and I am so happy I would buy another phone from these guys! Great work and thank you"
1604,"I was pleasantly surprised by this phone. I saw so many other negative reviews and I was pretty hesitant but I got it just to try it. Other than some paint chips around the edges and some light scratches on the back of the phone, this phone is pretty much like new (mine came with 96% battery life). For the price, you really can’t beat it."
1605,Bought used and it looked almost 100% new out of the box. It was flawlessly intact. Works great with no bugs hiccups.
1606,Phone unlocked works great with Mint Mobile.
1607,"Storage, resolution, speed, and sound are all of remarkable quality.The only caveat i've discovered is that the Face ID is corrupted and unredeemable (obviously not a huge deal, but I was looking foward to that ability)"
1608,"Product just as promised, no issues, love the phone."
1609,"I really wanted to like this phone as an upgrade from my iphone 6s, but after doing a software update, it would not let me send or receive any text messages that had images from someone who had an Android phone. I even checked online to see if anyone else had that problem and I wasn't alone. The seller was wonderful about accepting the return."
1610,"Clean, free of wear and exactly what I orddred"
1611,Honestly I thought I was going to be mad but in all actuality I am please. It’s came exactly as design and everything works properly.only problem I brought it for 432$ and they sold it for 409$ after taxes so other than that take the chance
1612,Product came in excellent condition without any scratches or problems.
1613,"This phone works great, though it took some time to get used to not having the Home button but finding it’s  actually easier. The phone came well packaged with a universal cable and wall adapter but no headphones. Some reviews mention this as a show stopper but it wasn’t a big deal to me. I was only concerned about the phone working. While in town I noticed the phone showing 5G and it is considerably faster when not on WIFI than my old iPhone 7Plus. I give this phone a high review as it worked and was easy to set up!"
1614,I wanted to wait awhile before i did this review to see how the phone handled and if it has any problems shockingly it doesn’t at all its like buying it from Verizon it self everything is fully functional the phone is in perfect condition since this is my first time buying a phone or electronic online im very happy with my phone it’s definitely a bang for your buck
1615,I like it it’s just a used phone that’s clean I was worried at first but it’s great overall battery health  was at 90+A few minor scratches I think I put a screen protector on so it’s not at all recognizable
1616,"The iPhone XR looks new.  No complaints there.  It performs well and battery capacity exceeds 90%.  So no complaints there either.  My issue is the sound quality.  The speakers sound muffled or hazy.  There is fluctuation in the sounds level as well.  The only way I enjoy using the phone is via my Bluetooth AirPods.  I realize the phone is ""reconditioned.""  But now I'm beginning to think the previous owner of the phone had an issue with the sound as well and just dumped it because they didn't want to pay to get it repaired.  I'm very disappointed!"
1617,Unfortunately I had to return it because it had network issues. All the troubleshooting recommendations didn’t fix the issue. It would work fine through Bluetooth but using it as an actual phone didn’t work.However Amazon/Woot accepted it back and send a full refund.
1618,"Phone felt and looked brand new, well worth. As a apple repair tech i didnt see any noticeable issues with the device and am very pleased with my purchase."
1619,"Upgrading from an old iPhone SE. had some difficulty inserting my Sim card, texted the company after business hours. They immediately responded by text the next morning, asked if I could send image of problem. However I was able to resolve the issue and get the Sim card inserted. Beautiful screen image. Battery had to be charged upon arrival"
1620,"Phone is overall in pretty good condition, besides some scratches on the back. Phone says its at 89% battery life which isn’t bad in my opinion. Wish I could have received a better charger, the one I was sent couldn’t have been longer than 2-3 inches."
1621,"Very disappointed that the battery health was inlu 84% the first time I turned it on. My last phone, iPhone 8, had a battery health of 85% and that is the inly reason I even bought a new phone. I hate that I have to plug my phone in a few times throughout the day! I. Know I bought this refurbished but I didn’t even save enough to go get a new battery! Which I’ll have to go get very soon! Had I known this, I would’ve just bought one brand new in ebay for about $50-$75 more"
1622,I really like it. I got one for myself and my wife. Order one for my oldest son to. Will be ordering another for my daughter soon. As far as the seller fantastic got it on time and as described.
1623,"Phone came quickly and pleasantly surprised us. It looked and worked almost like new. Battery level is 97 %. No scratches, everything works. Only complaint is the charging cable is only 6 inches long. Fortunately we had a longer one already."
1624,So far it’s great I’ve only had the phone for a few days not even a week yet looks brand new Battery is questionable I charged it yesterday around 1 and I’m charging it again it could be me but I love it
1625,i bought this phone for my dad and as far as i know it works and he loves it.
1626,"I got pretty scared when I saw the reviews and the pictures that were being left by some buyers but decided to purchase anyway since it has a 90 day return policy. It is awesome! It is in amazing condition, seriously looks brand new, the battery health is 89%and it is so quick an beautiful! I upgraded from a 6s to this one and I am so happy. Can not recommend more, I feel lucky to have found this deal."
1627,"I was a little nervous to buy. Just received the phone and I am very happy! If I am going to be extremely picky, the only tell that it was refurbished was it was a little dirty around the camera. But there are no scratches the screen seems responsive so far. It even came with a screen protector. I will update after the holidays when I contact att to let everyone know if it’s black listed or reported stolen lol."
1628,"Upon opening the package, the phone appeared new. No scratches, or dings. However upon booting up and testing, BAD EAR SPEAKER. At half volume you couldn’t hear the person on the other side of the phone. At full volume it was completely muffled, Still barely able to hear. It also seemed rather slow and clunky, similar to my 4 year old iPhone 8. A replacement has been ordered."
1629,So far I’m using the phone nothing to complain aboutThe phone is doing pretty well and came earlier than expected
1630,Perfect
1631,The phone got here before its expected time. Very nice product
1632,Equipo en perfectas condiciones y funcionamiento
1633,"This is a great phone from a great program. I was a bit hesitant to buy a used phone but the Amazon Renew 90-day return made me take the chance.  The phone was in mint condition, looks and works like a brand new one and 9-months later, there have been NO problems. Would buy my next phone from this amazing Amazon program.The seller, BUYSPRY also delivered it days ahead of schedule so I would buy from them again."
1634,"I read some of the reviews and I was concerned about the phone not working. It works just fine. The camera quality is ok to my standards because I upgraded the IOS to 14 , you can put the camera in 4K and play with the lighting. No marks on the screen, a little light Line on the back of the phone but you don’t even notice and the cute phone case makes a big difference!! Overall I’m satisfied."
1635,"My phone came from D'Tech Mobile. It looks like a brand new phone, but the battery health was at 97%, so it's not completely renewed. Aside from that, the phone I received is great. No scratches or scuffs, and it even came with a screen protector already applied. The charger I was sent isn't an original Apple product, but that's fine considering I already have several of those around the house. I was able to activate it through Verizon without any trouble."
1636,"I got this phone as an upgrade for my 3 year old 6s after reading all of the reviews. I was the slightest bit skeptical at first, but once I ordered it, it arrived a week earlier than expected! The only damage I could see was some minor dents and chips along some of the aluminum corners, but other than that this phone looks brand new. It even came with a new battery!I would definitely recommend buying this product. It’s worth every penny.PS: this phone doesn’t come with headphones, but they already state that in the description."
1637,"10/10 recommend using this company the next time you’re looking for a new phone! Received the phone today and absolutely flawless!! Looks brand spanking new, great battery life! Definitely a great upgrade from my iPhone 7 to the iPhone XR! Also I must add how quickly the phone came to me, I ordered it Wednesday afternoon and got it Saturday morning!!! Thank you very much, I absolutely love my new phone!"
1638,"Don’t buy this phone ,I ordered it Wednesday September 7 and it was supposed to arrive today which is Saturday but it arrived the day after I ordered it and when I got it everything looked brand new but the phone didn’t turn on so I thought it needed to be charged so plugged it in and after a few hours I checked and it still had a red bar so I left it overnight and it was still dead it is now Saturday September 10th and this phone doesn’t work . I got scammed out of my money and I very upset ."
1639,"I like this phone so much it’s so beautiful no blemishes, the only thing that makes me a lil sad is the 89% battery life other than that I have 0 complaints to be made, 9/10 would recommend"
1640,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Phone is perfect look like new and it also come with a screen protector installed which is great.
1641,"The screen has a very visible detail, I am sad with the purchase. Wait longer."
1642,"Bought one for me and my fiancé. She got a white 1 I got a black 1. Truly impressed on how quickly they arrived. Literally 2 days after I ordered them. Both in like new conditions, no scratches or any type of wear. Battery life is a lot stronger than our iPhone 8’s, face recognition is amazing, and the camera is fantastic. Truly happy with the purchase."
1643,"I was always rather cautious about buying amazon renewed products because of the bad reviews, but after purchasing this renewed phone, I can safely say that I am very glad that I went with this phone! Iphone came in a non Apple box with just a standard cord and charger, but was practically in band new condition! The only fault was rather small chip on the top edge of the phone, hardly noticeable even without the case. The phone was fully unlocked as advertised so transferring my data and SIM card was absolutely no trouble whatsoever. I will definitely be interested in buying more renewed Apple products off amazon after this experience. 5/5!"
1644,"I would like to change the device, please confirm if I am able to return the device to the store in person, I live in Newark NJ, it seems that you have physical stores in New York am I able to go there. Regards.."
1645,"Maybe it’s not really captured in the pic but it’s scratchy on the back and there’s like a little yarn/string that looks like the final touching process hasn’t finished yet. But so far the camera, music, touch screen works."
1646,I was hesitant like everyone else before buying but when I received the phone I was very happy with it. After using it for two weeks I can confirm it’s definitely worth the money. The phone came in with 97% battery life and no damage at all other than a little wear and tear on the side buttons. It came nicely packaged and had a screen protector already on it!
1647,Everything was just as started in listing. Looks and works like a new phone. No complaints.
1648,"We just received this iPhone Xr yesterday and set it up.  It was easy and set up flawlessly in about an hour or two. The phone looks like it has never been used, and Amazon gave me $40. for my iPhone 6Plus.  They paid postage both ways and I am excited to be able to upgrade at such a reasonably low cost.  Time will tell if the battery is OK per my 4-star rating.."
1649,"I was a little nervous to buy this product just because anything not “new” is never promised to be worth the price. If I had not known myself that this was refurbished I would have thought it was new. Everything works perfectly and though it didn’t come with an apple charger, it did come with a charger and wall plug that works fine as well as a case and screen protector. Pleasantly surprised with this purchase"
1650,"This phone came in great condition just one small scratch which wasn’t a problem . Screen quality and battery life was 100%. It didn’t come with factory charger or headphones but it did come with a nice, protective phone case. I highly recommend !"
1651,"the iPhone came with defects but we only found out too late.We bought the iphone in July and we recently realized the mic is not working while the phone is on speaker mode. we took the iphone to Apple store and the store said it is a major defect and the fix will cost $399. additionally, the store also said the battery is in very poor condition and need replacement.We contacted the seller and was told we missed the warranty deadline and there is nothing to be done.It is our fault not to keep an eye on the deadline but I think the iphone we purchased from the seller was defective to start with.tips for future buyers: do take your iphone to a store for a diagnostic check before the warranty deadline."
1652,This product is amazing the face id 8s wonderful and I am upgrading from an iphone 7 to this iphone xr and it is such a great upgrade I love how big the screen is and I'm glad I upgradedMine even came with 80% battery which was awesome also mine came with a clear case which is super protective overall I am very pleased with my purchase and I'm glad I bought it
1653,Great product and yes... it’s fully unlocked. Decided to upgrade and take a chance on getting this upgrade from my 6S. Had my doubts but got a great product with very little cosmetic scratches. It’s was easy to switch over and came with easy to use instructions 🙌🏾
1654,"I really like this new phone! I had no idea how slow my old phone was until I upgraded to the Iphone XR. It fits well in my hand and the screen is bigger. I like the face recognition, my fingerprint ID did not work well on my old phone because I work with my hands and my fingerprint was never the same each day."
1655,everything is great and even came with a screen protector already on. but my top speaker is very messed up. The sound is extremely muffled and bubbly. I have tried various was to clean it but no luck.
1656,"Phone arrived early, nicely packed, and is what my grandson wanted. The phone looks really good, about perfect I would say. The battery is very strong and even was charged up. We tested it out and it appeared to work just fine. It is a birthday present so he doesn't get it until then. If there are any problems  we will know for sure then. I would buy from this seller again."
1657,"Recvd phone in just a few days, looked in excellent condition,  added T-mobile service and use our home wifi when needed. No problems as of yet, only happy 😊.  I have to admit I was worried after reading some of the negative ratings..goes to show that sometimes the good does trump the negative.  Thank you for the positive experience!"
1658,"I absolutely LOVE this phone! It came in great condition and works efficiently. It came with everything it said it would (the charger and key). My phone didn’t have any scratches or cracks, I love the coral color so much. I’m so glad I took a risk and purchased it! My provider is straight talk so if you use straight talk or the other providers they use and want this phone I would definitely recommend it 🧡"
1659,My son loved it.
1660,This is a great median for those who don’t want to spend a fortune getting the newest iphone or be stuck with old hardware that doesn’t have the common features that newer phones have.Had mine for about 6 months no issues other than it can be hard to hear out of its main call speaker. I usually use head phones or talk on speaker anyway🤷🏻‍♂️
1661,"OMG my BEST buy on Amazon of ALL time!!!! It was beautiful, immaculate! Only wish they had one in white for Verizon! But this hands down is perfect, no scratches, smooth setup to Verizon. They hook you up with a free case and a temper glass that was a super surprise to me! And they were high quality accessories. It’s a steal to be honest. Thank you so much to this seller! Xo"
1662,"Nothing not to like, has many features and works well with my IWATCH 6 - independent phone optioned"
1663,"I  bought this phone, even though I knew it would be a task to learn how to use it.  Fortunately, I have had some good help from friends and Apple sources so it has not  been The Impossible Dream.  I am picking up things all of the time.  But if you are in a hurry or don't want to put the time into learning how to use it; forget it.  It will not be worth your time."
1664,"Bought this Phone on January 6 and I was able to get this item within in 3 days. Came with a Charger and Black Charging box which was one of the down sides, the phone came completely clean ready to boot up. Day after there’s no problem with the phone runs completely fine, my only other problems is that I wish the battery would of came at 100% but mine came at 94% which is still great. And there was no damage on the phone besides one light scratch on the top speaker of the phone which isn’t visible to the naked eye. So besides that the phone is working at its full capacity."
1665,"I have total wireless and ordered this phone unlocked and it was not compatible with total wireless. i had to return it and buy the same phone but Verizon instead and now it works! Other than that the phone is great, battery health at 94% (the first one i ordered was 86%) and works fine no damage at all!"
1666,This seller is incredible! Shipped very fast. And the best part is the phone had zero scratches!!! I’ve bought a couple of refurbished phones before and all of them had some sort of dents on them. But not this one. This phone looked totally brand new when I took it out of the box. I highly recommend this seller. I do not think you can find a better purchase if price is your concern
1667,"El teléfono está como nuevo, no tiene un solo raspón, la vrdd estaba muy asustada antes de hacer la compra pero al ver las reseñas del vendedor, me decidí, llegó muy rápido, dos días antes de lo anunciado incluso, todo funciona correctamente, me alegro de haber hecho la compra. Lo único malo pero entendible, la batería está al 88% de su funcionamiento, pero el resto. Súper bien!"
1668,                    The media could not be loaded.                
1669,"I was very unsure about purchasing this but to my surprise it has been worth every penny! No scratches, dents or damage! Looks brand new and works great!"
1670,It’s like a new iPhone and it came with a iPhone box and surprise me.
1671,"Don’t buy iPhone from this seller, terrible iPhone, no many issues related with this iphone"
1672,Just received my phone. I actually ordered it as an early Valentine’s day gift for my bf. It came with a free case which was super helpful since I’m still waiting on a screen protector. So far there’s no damages to the phone at all. I was a little nervous because of some of the bad reviews but since it was $350 I decided to take the chance of it & I’m glad I did. He loves it!
1673,10/10 100% perfect
1674,"Todo bien, completamente liberado, tenía unos desgaste leves en una esquina del marco, la parte de atrás esta bien pasa desapercibido algunas líneas de desgaste, cámara frontal esta muy bien, tiene una seña como q estuviera por dentro algo, no sé si es q así son, pero igual no afecta en nada las fotos salen excelentes en frontal y trasera."
1675,Love the phone. The only thing i don't like is when im talking on the phone it sounds like its under water a little bit but when the call is on speaker ots perfectly fine. That would be my only complaint
1676,"I received the phone early, it came boxed nicely and with a charger and wall mount. Not upset I didn’t receive earphones as I already own Air Pods. A no Scratches no Cracks or Dents! Camera is excellent as expected and phone is beautiful. I ordered it in the color blue 64 gig. Great buy."
1677,"I just recieved my phone yesterday,it looks exactly as it is in the pictures and as described,  there is NO scratch on the phone, it looks just beautiful,  the seller is nice to send a screen protector and a case, it also came with a charger,  ( not Apple original charger)But it should work, i didnt use it, since i got original charger from my previous phone, its definitely worth the price and im happy , i haven't activated yet, but i set it up, and everything went smoothly and as expected,  thank you !!"
1678,Would use this seller again.
1679,"Not a scam! Received the phone a day early. It has 100% battery life and looks brand new. No wear and tear at all. The only thing I didn’t like was the fact that it did not come inside an actual Apple box, and even though the charger is Apple, I received a random off-brand charger block instead of a regular Apple one. Other than that, I love it! Thanks!!"
1680,My daughter loved her phone haven’t put it down since she gotten it.
1681,It’s a beautiful phone worked great no damage just perfect but the only issue was the imei number wasn’t ready for activation. Not sure why but I was able to send it back and get a refund. The company replied back in a timely manner. Great customer service I must add!
1682,"First let me say, it came in right on time. The battery life is already at a 93% for life. I have had this phone for one day. The charger cord sent with it does not charge it. Luckily I had a wireless charger to charge the phone on."
1683,Product was perfect and it came earlier than expected. Was able to switch all of my data from old phone to this one.
1684,Super shock how nice and clean it was only had some tiny scuffs on one corner that I almost missed clean screen battery life was 89% but for what phones stores was trying to sell me an 8 for 600 bucks and the power button didn’t work u can’t go wrong wit this one very happy I finally got this

1686,"Todo bien, el único detalle es el speaker, ya que no se escucha como debe"
1687,"Phone is in great shape, screen looks new and phone arrived with iOS 14. Phone came with a charger and case as well. No problem moving my info/files from Android (took a few hours though) or installing the nano-SIM (Verizon) which only took a few minutes. Good purchase overall. FedEx took a few extra days to deliver the phone, but that's understandable this time of the year. I recommend requiring a signature at delivery. Worth the wait..."
1688,"I was skeptical after reading some bad reviews, but am very happy with my purchase of this phone. I ordered from the seller MyWit. It doesn’t not come with original packaging (which is fine with me.) It came with the device and a lighting cable. It didn’t come with a charging brick, which seemed odd, but I have several so it didn’t matter to me. Shipping was very fast.It came at 100% battery capacity. The device itself had no signs of use. Looked brand new. No scratches or anything. If you’re on the fence, I would definitely suggest going for it."
1689,"I very much appreciate the business. The quality of the phone is nere perfect. It would have been perfect, if a pair of earbuds were thrown into the box. Lol"
1690,"We purchased these for traveling so we needed them unlocked.Arrived one day early, we tried them in other country and worked.The battery life of one of them was 90%, very cool.The other has battery at 82%, Ii was expecting a little bit more, but not an issue.They came with new glasses to be installed and one of the phones had a new cover to use with it.Very nice vendor, 100% recommended!"
1691,"Good with the phone but the lightning cable is not OEM and it doesn’t work right. It get lose at minimum movement so it’s not extra fe that after long time, the cable was not correctly set and there ‘s no charge. They should invest in a better cable."
1692,Met my expectations
1693,                    The media could not be loaded.                
1694,So i read reviews like everyone else and found that the reviews were good but I was still unsure. I ordered and took a chance. I was surprised at how quickly it got here from New York. I opened the box and found just what it said was there. a phone in bubble wrap and a non apple charger and non apple charging cord. but the phone was all apple. I first turned it on and checked and found that it still had a factory warranty (two months worth). The screen was almost new and the body of the phone had no scratches at all. Would buy again in a heart beat.
1695,I ordered this iPhone XR I was worried it would not come in perfect condition but I decided to order it and guess what that was one of my best purchase I did it came in will condition battery was at 96% screen was in perfect condition camera was good I would recommend it. The seller was Hybrid It
1696,"The product came with a charger.I am using this product for necessity.  Setup was a learning experience.I tested the features like light, sound, camera, and games with no issues.My cell phone provider switched my SIM card from my old iPhone5 to this product with no issues.  I like this product and hope it will last a long time. Review written on day 4 of the product."
1697,"El teléfono me llego unos días después de lo acordado, tardo aproximadamente 3 semanas en llegar a mis manos, compre desde Tucumán, Argentina y para los que tengan dudas como yo lo tuve les aconsejo que compren sin miedo, el teléfono llego en excelente estado ningún detalle a destacar, la batería 97% y llego sin problemas!"
1698,"The battery on the phone died about a month after I received it, which I wasn’t happy about. But I contacted the seller and they immediately offered to either give me a refund or replace the battery for free. I chose to the latter and they replaced the battery and sent it back to me very quickly. I was really pleased with the customer service I got."
1699,
1700,"Works like a new phone  , no complaints here ."
1701,Everything works as it should
1702,Had the iPhone X and it started loosing signal. Would have to turn it off and back on to connect but then would only last for a while. This all happened after a month of the Purchase. Returned the phone and replaced it with the XR. Like it so much better. The size is more like the 8plus but not as heavy. So far so good with it!
1703,"The battery input doesn't have teeth, so it is impossible to charge with a cord. Had to buy a cordless charger to recharge it. The phone works, but it is very inconvenient. Struggled with whether to send it back or not. Decided to keep it and just be inconvenienced."
1704,So far so good phone works great the phones battery is at 93% full battery capacity which personally I think is good  also I got a unlocked iPhone XR red with 128gb  also they had it for a very good price when I bought it and they send me a letter with the phone saying there was lower price than what they had listed but they told me they weren’t going to charge me extra or cancel the order  that why have them a 5 star
1705,Received this phone and was happy to find that it looked brand new. Battery health is at 91% which is well above the promised 80%. Been using with Mint Mobile without issue. Very satisfied.
1706,I orderd from Chibbiestech. This phone is like brand new. There was one little ding on the top and the brim of the camera is a little chipped but nothing noticeable! Had trouble with my sim card but fixed that. Totally unlocked. And everything works great! The battery percentage was 89% but it could be worse.Thanks again
1707,"I returned the first iPhone since it had minor scratches and was able to do this with no issue at all.  However, when I repurchased the replacement phone the price had gone up. Contacted the customer service and they did not honor the original price after this was made to their attention. Overall, I would recommend the phone to another person but the customer service was not satisfying as a buyer."
1708,"The phone works very well, no scratches or faults. The only thing I’d say bad about it was the battery life was low but it was still above 85% so that was okay"
1709,Great buy. It came early. No problems when I set it up. No issues getting it activated ( I have metro pcs). I’ve had it for a few months and still work great. It doesn’t die fast. It charges fine. Updates fine. Overall I’m very satisfied with my purchase. It is worth the money.
1710,"Came scratched and clearly used. If I did not use a screen protector, it would look years old."
1711,"I bought two XR of 64gOne for me and one for my girlfriend, they are both working well and they look flawlessI would recommend to buyBoth of them where unlocked of any service provider or iCloudThey both came with a new screen protector already installed and the charger and the cable (not factory original)"
1712,"After reading all the reviews and pulled the trigger on the coral xr. Phone came with a screen protector already on(thank you from someone with ocd). This phone is basically brand new I couldn't find any scratches dent cracks, nothing. Fired it up signed in and updated. Tested everything including the cams.  This phone is flawless. Definitely as advertised and better. Super happy with seller and prouduct"
1713,Lol I’m using it to write this review I love it
1714,Found no issues. Took it to Jamaica and it works great
1715,87% Battery. Love it.
1716,The product met every expectation I know my granddaughter loves it!
1717,I really do love the phone! I haven’t had any issues with it so far! The only thing that is kind of “messed” up would be if you turn the volume super loud it kind of gets staticky.
1718,"I purchased 2 of these before I read the reviews and after reading the reviews it made me nervous.  Got the phones today and both of them are in GREAT SHAPE!!  Looks brand new, battery maximum capacity is 98% of both phones.  No dings or scratches.  Plugged my sim card in and it picked it up automatically!!!  This was a GREAT BUY!!!  So far...."
1719,"Everything is ok, great product in optimal conditions!! No scratches. Working good!!"
1720,"Although it's definitely not NEW, the phone I received is a great phone considering how cheap it was.  The only issues I've found are illustrated in the pictures:  a few scratches around the camera lens that I don't really care about and a replacement for the back cover.  Neither of these issues was a deal breaker for me.93% battery life!  Super fast processing with no glitches. Took some photos to test it out (since I was nervous about the scratches around the lens) and they turned out beautifully!  I'm thrilled."
1721,Exactly as described! Looks and works like brand new! Would definitely recommend!
1722,The Iphone has good condition and I received the package in less time that I expeted
1723,I had an iPhone XR previously but it had shattered. I was a bit iffy about buying a phone from Amazon but it’s just the same! I’m using it to write this review actually. But it’s the same. Not a scam. Good price.
1724,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 After many YouTube videos n reviews I finally bout the Phone I got the XR in white. I was a bit reluctant cause all the comments said they didn’t get headphones n I was scared that the battery health would be below 80% but battery health is at 100%, my phone came with the earphones n a charger. No cracks or scratches. I ordered it 6/27/20 n got it 6/30/20, my seller was Gryphon Commerce. This is definitely a big upgrade from my iPhone 6."
1725,"Phone came in a very good condition with some cosmetic issues on the screen nothing major just regular use , battery and performance are overall perfect, fully unlocked I just inserted the new SIM and it was working just perfect"
1726,"I was scared to buy a phone on here but I read the reviews and so I decided to buy it, omg I’m so happy!! The life on the phone is %100 looks brand new I’ve had it for 2 weeks and I haven’t had any problems. I’m so happy. It came with a charger but no ear buds but that’s ok I don’t care for them anyways. I’m very happy."
1727,We got this iphone to replace an old one. The condition was very good(a few scratches. It was able to start up and able to access our T-mobile sim card. We started working on the phone as it was fine. The only issue is that the battery is not new but the charge is reasonable (we always bring a spare power brick with us)The vaue is ok as I would buy it again but knowing I may get a not good one. It is a gamble.
1728,This was a awesome deal. The phone looked great no scratches. The battery don’t last as long as I’m used to but I’m also coming from an android phone to an iPhone so I really don’t have anything to compare it to. It didn’t come in original packaging or come with the original charger other then that the phone is great
1729,"Works perfect, couldn’t ask for more"
1730,Like my yellow phone. Dislike the battery life it has.  Doesn’t stay charged long and takes a long time to charge.
1731,Pantalla con una mancha blanca y se nota q era una pantalla cambiada porque la parte inferior izquierda venía despegada y al tacto se movía. Todo lo demás estaba como nuevo aunque la batería venía con 88% de vida útil. Tuve que devolver este pedido quedé muy insatisfecho
1732,Immaculate condition!
1733,I was honestly very happy with what came in. It looked very close to factory new and I was not expecting the device to be in this condition. Am completely satisfied 10/10. Delivery also came 1 day ahead of schedule!! I didn’t even know it came with a screen protector or charger as well! Even the sim removal tool
1734,"I received the phone within a timely manner and it is just like new! I couldn't wait until it arrived. It came in safe packaging, with no scratches on screen or camera, no issues with any of the tech, everything is working perfectly!! The battery is amazing and so much better compared to my old iPhone 7. I have been using this new phone for over a month now and I am still incredibly happy with my purchase and am surprised at great condition it is for being renewed. I would recommend anyone to buy a renewed/refurbished phone especially from Amazon. Hope this helps anyone who needs it :)"
1735,"So far so good, the phone came in good condition, but the phone was turned was on and the box was a little open when I received it. The packaging on the outside was sealed so the phone should've been okay regardless. So far I've had no issues with the phone, it came with a charger, no headphones though! which is perfectly fine (I have my own regardless) I think it just random if you get all the products or not. But either way you are paying for the phone and it's a great price anyways, comes with what you need so take a chance it may end in an amazing purchase!Will update as time goes on as I've only recently received it!"
1736,"I was a little nervous ordering a 'Renewed' phone, but my experience with this product has been great. I received the item two days early and item look, just about new. I am pretty perceptive and noticed just a few shallow scratches on the back and nick on the corner. Honestly, they're not noticeable and I probably would easily do just as much damage myself within the first day or two. I'm completely satisfied with this product."
1737,I have had a Moto for 5 years and it broke. During the time I had an iPhone and brought it from someone and it came messed up so I was skeptical of buying an iPhone online. I read a bunch of reviews and finally did it. I am beyond glad because it came and looks brand new. Nothing is wrong with it. And I got to switch my bill for my little phone to this one for free with sprint. I love it.❤️
1738,Muy buen producto. El punto negativo es rendimiento de la batería
1739,"Phone came in like new condition!!!  Not a mark on it.  Battery life shows 100%.  This is the 3rd Amazon refurbished phone my family has used (other 2 still going strong) and they’ve all been perfect.If you’re thinking about getting a Amazon refurbished iPhone, do it!  You likely won’t be disappointed.  I have zero hesitation recommending people to buy one, and this will be the first place J look when we need another phone."
1740,Muy buen equipo y en buen estado sin embargo trajo un problema en el auricular no se escucha muy bien cuando recibes llamadas.
1741,Excellent buy
1742,It met my expectations. It’s the first day hence the 4 star. It probably will have been 5 stars
1743,The SIM Removable Tool was NOT included in the package.
1744,me grado el producto todo en perfecto estado excelente compra y los tiempos acordador
1745,"Great condition, everything works"
1746,This is my first ever review for Amazon and iPhone seller. I have been Amazon costumer last 10 years never written any reviews. I am tech guy. I know lot about the phone. This is my second day with this phone but I have to say this is the best refurbished phone I have purchased. Came out like brand new. Looks new and works like brand new. Big thumbs up to seller.
1747,"This phone was absolutely perfect. It looked just like a brand new phone. All we had to do was put the old SIM card into this one because it didn’t come with one, but that was fine. Once the old SIM card was put into this one everything from her old phone was in the new one. Would purchase again."
1748,Love the device. It does have a little single scratch and the earpiece got push but there’s no problem with the sound quality. The battery life is biggest problem for me but I guess that’s what you get from paying lower price from the brand new one. But the phone overall is working just fine.
1749,I really like this phone
1750,"Love this thing! I needed a definite upgrade from the 7 I’d once had. It arrived so fast, and looked brand freakin new! Gorgeous color. And the best part is it came with 95% battery life. No damage at all. If I didn’t know any better I’d think it was never used at all! Charges fast, crystal clear camera, love the facial recognition."
1751,Very happy with my iPhone. Same here. I was skeptical about buying refurbished but this particular seller sold me a very clean functioning iPhone. It’s been almost a year. And it’s still working fast and efficient. Give it a try guys. I was very happy with my purchase. Or go spend $500+ new at the Apple store
1752,"Perfect condition! I was warned there would be a small cosmetic scratch on the corner but I don’t see ANY marks! I’m very impressed! It came with a charger, charging box & a tool to get the sim holder out! You need to buy your own sim & attachment for your Aux but you gotta do that separately on most phones! 😊"
1753,Very disappointed in this seller! The vibrate button is broken and the whole phone rattles. This is straight out the box. Had to spend extra money to have it fixed today due to the return policy. It would take a week. I was buying for a birthday gift.For that amount of money everything should work!STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!!!
1754,"The yellow color is so vivid and bright, which I love! I was scared it was going to be faded but it was all in vain. It came in great condition and still works a year later. Would buy again, if I could afford it ://"
1755,"Everything worked out great. Shipped on time and there is no visible damage on the phone. The only problem is that one of the speakers' sound quality isn't great. May have been damaged from the previous owner. However, I understand that this was refurbished, so that is okay. Thank you!"
1756,"So far so good. I just got the iPhone yesterday and nothing seems to be wrong so far. The battery capacity is at 97% which isn’t too bad since it’s refurbished. It came with the plastic wrapping, the box, block, and charger. I almost thought it was completely new when I first saw it. There are no scratches on the phone. I’ll edit the review if I find something wrong."
1757,Device had a lot more cosmetic issues than I would have expected. Clearly visible scratches and scuffs on the back and edges of the phone. I get that it's a reverb but I've gotten refurbished devices directly from one of the major carriers in the past that were visibly like new. I would think for the money the device would have fewer if any cosmetic issues. I've given the criteria 4 stars as function seems to be good though it's hard to give it a good workover as I've only had it for a few days. Battery needs to go through more charging cycles to determine how well it holds a charge.
1758,"Overall satisfied with this phone. Doesn’t have any problems functionality wise, and came with 100% battery health, so no complaints there, but it had a scratch in the top corner of the screen, and some scuffs on the body. I got it with the 20% discount, so these issues don’t worry me. Wish it would have come with the lightning-to-3.5mm dongle, but again not a big deal considering the savings I got"
1759,Good
1760,"I like how they were upfront and honest about possible scratches on the phone. My phone came in and it is in great condition. Battery life is good and works really well. One thing that did bug me was the scratches around the back camera, but they did warn me beforehand!"
1761,"I had no problems at all with the phone except that I had to buy a new SIM card for the phone, but everything else was great. No problems with face recognition, battery life was at 84%, and the screen quality is amazing. No cracks, no scratches."
1762,The phone is literally in perfect condition! Not a scratch on the phone or anything. Only reason I’m giving 4 stars is because it didn’t come with the SIM card removal tool. Other than that it’s perfect!
1763,This was a good purchase . But it do have glitches
1764,Speakers sound pretty bad
1765,"So far a good purchase. I purchased an IPhone XR from the seller Trademore. I received it 3 days after purchase! Much faster than was expected. It came nicely packaged and clean. It came with a charger and a SIM card tool to transfer. There were some scuffs around 2 corners of the phone where it was previously dropped. Luckily they are veryyy light. The battery health is at 97%! Also I purchased a 128GB and received a 256GB, so I am not complaining! Lol I’m enjoying the phone and it’s been a great experience so far! Thank you!"
1766,"NO SCAM!I had an iPhone 6s for years so i finally decided to switch. This phone is amazing. This seller is great, I got my phone fast, no damage to it and the battery came at 80%. Also comes with a screen protected and charger. Just wish it came with headphones. I would buy from this seller."
1767,My phone arrived on time in absolutely perfect condition. I checked all over and there's not a single scratch or dent on this thing. It also has a brand new battery. It didn’t come with a stock Apple charger or headphones but that doesn't bother me.
1768,Good Quality
1769,Happy with purchase .  But after 2-3 weeks of use am finding that people I talk to on the phone are complaining that they cannot hear me properly. Looks like the microphone is malfunctioning.
1770,I bought this phone as a replacement for my daughter. Well she finally needed it so I took it to get activated which is when I was told it was locked!! Now I’m out of hundreds of dollars and activation fees!! I could not locate a valid number to call for assistance!!’
1771,"Has been a great phone for my 13yr old, nice camera screen is in perfect shape that I can tell for a refurbished phone and the battery lasts all day with heavy use. So far we are really happy with the purchase."
1772,"Ordered the phone on a Friday night, it arrived Monday, a day earlier than projected.  No issues so far, daughter is very happy with her new phone!  I was concerned that others reviewers said their phone had been reported stolen and could not be activated, but ours was fully unlocked and we activated it without issue."
1773,As expected
1774,Looks new and is very clean. Comes with a screen protector
1775,All around good just change the shipping equipment
1776,"Great phone, you will not be disappointed, I wasn’t sure at first but I gave  it a try and I don’t regret it. I don’t see any scratches on the screen or the back.. overall I am very happy with the purchased"
1777,AMAZING PHONE!! JUST LIKE BRAND NEW. I GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE WITH AN AMAZING BATTERY. TY!
1778,Me reading these reviews made me almost not want to try them out. But after a day of thinking I said what the heck you won’t know if you don’t try. The price was reasonable and the quality of the product was much more than what I was expecting.  I had no problem getting it turned on through metro pcs and all the features work perfectly fine as well. BuySPRY thank you and I will return for my kids too.
1779,"Bought this phone last week, works perfectlyNo scratches, and looks brand new. Battery health is at 92 which was expected but everything else is perfect."
1780,For a refurbished phone it is very good! There was a little dirt in the speaker at the top of the phone (it did not hinder my ability to listen) and the phone came in a android box. Other then that it is a very good phone and worth the price
1781,"Downloaded personal data, pictures, emails, and such from the cloud.  Went to the gadget store, where we took the broken phone that this one was replacing, to retrieve the SIM card.  Put in the SIM card and phone seemed to be working.  My son started texting his friends to let them know his replacement phone had arrived.  And in about five minutes of using the phone it suddenly started glitching out, random items scrolling, touch screen wouldn’t respond so couldn’t close anything out.  The phone called EMS and we couldn’t hang it up.  It even sent out an emergency SOS to contacts.  Ran it back to the gadget fix shop and he was able to get it shut down.  Removed the SIM card and returning the phone.  What a mess and what a disappointment."
1782,It would have been nice but there was one very faint scratch on the the screen other then that so far so good
1783,"Si estás pensando en comprar un iPhone restaurado no lo pienses, será la mejor compra. Al principio tenía mis dudas por algunos comentarios negativos pero muchos de esos comentarios son de otros vendedores para bajar la calificación, este celular me salió a un súper precio y todo funciona perfectamente, el iPhone es original, la batería está perfecta y llego sin un solo raspón!! Seguramente pediré otro, llego en 5 días. Excelente compra"
1784,Some very tiny marks here and there but overall this a great buy and I’m very satisfied with the way it came and how it looks !!
1785,"Perfect. No issues so far. Phone was intact, unlocked, and looked new."
1786,Product came with damaged volume button.
1787,"I got the white fully unlocked iPhone XR and it worked for Xfinity Mobile, I didn’t think it was going to but it paired really easily. This phone is really nice and works really well. I would highly recommend it. The camera quality, battery life, and touch screen are amazing. This is not a scam. It also ships within a few hours and came all the way across the country within 2 days. I just ordered a second one!"
1788,"I was really sceptical about buying a new phone online but if you are looking for a renewed phone no dents or scratches and that can connect with any service you’ve came to the right place the battery life is great the screen quality is immaculate not one scratch comes with a screen protector, case, and charger. Just no headphones or AirPods and for the price who can beat it."
1789,"I was very skeptical at first especially buying it online however this company has truly gained my trust, the phone came in pristine condition every component of the phone works really well, the battery lasts all day even when you are on tiktok or fb all day and night, picture quality is immaculate, best of all the amount of storage I can have so much crap saved on my phone and it still has yet to slow down and I’ve had it a while now"
1790,"I really don’t buy refurbished stuff but I wanted something that was cheap but good for my brothers first phone. The phone came with everything that was advertised but the the camera was a bit scuffed, it does work though it just physical things. And the battery came with 96% battery health. Which is not a big deal."
1791,"Beautiful phone like new , they sent me a red one instead of blue but they were kind enough to Email me and made sure I was okay with it because they made a mistake and the blue wast available it had no scratches at all whatsoever , however I’m giving 4  starts because the company is very professional but  I had to return it, left speaker was not working and Bluetooth wasn’t working it couldn’t pair with any device , it’s a shame because I really loved the phone 😢"
1792,"I was really worried that it wouldn’t work with MetroPCS but all it took was a brand new SIM card and some patience. It’s great. I haven’t had any major issues or malfunctions. I do however, charge my phone at night. There have been two morning where I’ll be at 100% then like 20 minutes later be at 45% but once I hook it back up to the charger within minutes it’s back up. I’m not sure what that means but my phone lasts all day without charges in between. For the money I paid, I am highly impressed."
1793,"Came with a charger , perfect unlocked condition , great buy"
1794,"I was a little nervous ordering this without being able to see it. It was supposed to be in good condition,  but I must say I think it was in excellent condition. There was not a mark I could see on it. The battery life was at 97%, so I was very pleased with that. The phone was totally unlocked so I had no problem getting it switched over to my provider."
1795,I got mine and it is perfect batter like is excellent and no scratches I love it don’t watch the negative reviews guys I have to come back here and write mine but the packaging needs improvement and the charging cable is not working but everything is ok s far
1796,I’m not gonna write much I was scared about buying it I bought it in August and it still works like brand new I fell in love with it and it came with a screen protector!!
1797,"I was very skeptical about purchasing a Renewed Premium device from Amazon, but I can say now with certainty that this was a great purchase. I’ve had zero issues with the phone, it came almost brand new, with 100% battery life and virtually no scratching."
1798,Well i ordered it yesterday and got it today should have taken 3 days i think so great on that. The phone looks new no scratches so great there too. I activated it with no problem. I didn't get a chance to use the cam etc yet but I think it will be just fine. Have to say very happy thanks alot. I was worried ordering a referb but it is for my daughter who broke her phone and with this carona going on i needed her to have it. Awesome work people. I would recomend
1799,I like the purchase
1800,I found the phone to work perfectly but it just had a tiny scratch on the screen bearly visible but still there when u look for i but overall good phone
1801,"Despite being in ""excellent"" condition, the phone was actually defective and ended up costing my dad money.I bought this phone for my dad after he broke his old one. He spent $22 activating it at his carrier, only to discover after making a few phone calls that the microphone on the phone is BROKEN. It just doesn't work. So he had to spent more money reactivating his old phone.What an absolute joke. They claim they inspect the phones, but apparently didn't bother to check if the microphone, the most essential part of making a phone call, works. Just disgraceful."
1802,Good phone got it for my 10 year old her first phone it's cute sleek not heavy just the power button does not work to turn off the phone but will turn on not sure if it's how the phone works or a issue with the phone.
1803,Love the face recognition ❤
1804,"This was a refurb but no one would know it.  There were no scratches, dings or dents.  It came well packaged in a generic box and no earbuds which doesn't matter to is. This was to update another iPhone so already had apple buds. The phone itself was even covered in front and back with a protective film Great value for a great product.  Network has great customer service as well. They were quick and friendly in response to some questions that I had."
1805,Everything was as described. Major upgrade for a fair price.
1806,"I have bought 2 phones from this company they do a great job, my first one I had smashed so I had bought another one and it came completely fine both times, definitely worth it they are basically brand new"
1807,The battery’s health is at 89% which is fine the price is half of what a brand new one would be. The screen is perfect no scratches at all one of the phones did have some scratches on the corner of the screen on the metal part but with a case on you can’t see it. So far the phones are working perfectly.
1808,"I bought for my son and he loved the phone, works perfectly and looks like brand new."
1809,"Like others, I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of some reviews however, I received my phone yesterday and not only did it come in the original box, it came with a brand new Apple charger AND headphones. It says in the description that headphones are not included so this was a nice surprise. But wait! It gets better! This phone is STILL under warranty until this coming December!! The battery life is 100%, the screen and body are in mint condition, and all internal workings seem to be in working order. Very excited! Would recommend"
1810,"The speaker for hearing is low and u can hardly hear the other person on the line, so I have to use my Bluetooth to hear the person. Other than that I love the phone. If u have another one you can exchange out for the one I have that would be greatly appreciated."
1811,Phone works great!
1812,"Got my renewed iPhone XR about 3 months ago now. It's more than held up to the standards I would have for any new phone. When I received mine, it looked brand new, worked perfectly, and I've gotta say, if you're looking to switch ecosystems, this is the way to go. File transfer was easy, and after struggling to decide about switching from an android (galaxy s8), I really feel like I made the right call."
1813,"Not only was this iPhone so affordable and like new, but it also came with a FREE clear case ($18, we looked it up because we loved the case so much!) AND a screen protector! We were not expecting either of these! It also comes with a sim card tool so you can easily transfer yours without going to the Verizon store and paying them. Very impressed!"
1814,This phone came in perfect condition! I got my husband a red one and I got myself a yellow one!! We are definitely satisfied 100%!!We upgraded from iPhone 7s and were in LOVE with the cameras! They’re great for taking our product pictures since we work through our phones! There wasn’t a single scratch on either of them!! They arrived within 3 days from purchasing!
1815,I like that i received the cell phone early just in time for a birthday gift. Also working perfectly with Verizon
1816,"Good case, slim fit"
1817,The phone is on great condition but the camera have some scratches  on it and I’m very disappointed.
1818,I bought this phone for my son. I was very sceptical because of some bad reviews I read but took a chance. I am so glad I did. My son loves this phone and there was no damage whatsoever. I have not got it turned on yet but for the price and how great it works it doesn't matter to me if it's unlocked or not. Thank you!!!
1819,Came early. Fast/ Reliable
1820,"My husband's iPhone 7 was draining in just a few hours without him even using it.  We wanted one that had similar features, and I have an iPhone 11 that I like.  We got him this iPhone XR for maybe a little more than half what a new one would cost.  Nice variety of colors, works great, no problems with the provided charger/cable.  I'm glad we found this product rather than having to buy him a brand new one.  No complaints."
1821,"I was skeptical at first by reading the reviews, but I am really glad I took a chance and bought it. It works great! I don’t have any issues. Phone came with no scratches or damages. The battery life is not the greatest, but I heard that is typical for IPhones. No complaints!"
1822,No issue with product at all. Charger and cable were not stock but exceed expectations for perf and quality.
1823,I got my phone at 97% battery life so not to much aging. Overall very nice phone it’s certified like it said it is. My experience was great. Certified by an actual human being.
1824,Battery life is so great. Love it. Thank you Amazon
1825,"The BEST OPTION FOR PHONES... If you are not a tech “I gotta have the newest toys person” this is clearly the way to go by far... Phone looks and operates perfectly... If I didn’t know it was renewed, you can’t tell the difference between new and this one... Phone is Awesome! Upgraded from an iPhone 8+ that was having issues..."
1826,Left speaker doesn’t work.
1827,I love it and I’m ready for my case to come in but i gave it four stars because the screen was freezing up quite a bit yesterday 02/13/20 and i was getting real mad so i turned the phone off and back on & it was better hopefully it won’t happen again cause i haven’t dropped it since i got it and i received it on 02/11/2020
1828,This phone at first glance looked nice until I noticed the scratches all across the screen and one really deep scratch. The perimeter of the phone was also filthy covered in some type of really old dirt that I had to scrub off with a cleaning pad. Front camera quality isn’t that great either but I’ll live. If the phone starts acting up like I’ve seen in other reviews then I’ll go ahead and send it back for a refund or exchange.UPDATE: I haven’t noticed any glitches when the phone first came it was almost dead but as of now battery life is pretty great.
1829,I am so happy that I decided to come onto Amazon and order this phone. It is well worth the money! The shipping was very fast as well .. my phone came within 2 days. It’s been two months &&’ it works perfectly fine. It looked brand new as if it was never used before when I received it.
1830,The phone is in great condition. I would have given it five stars but the box arrived open and the charger did not work at all. Case was sold separately
1831,The screen has burn in from the previous owner or whoever was using the phone before me. Other than that the phone is really great.
1832,"The phone came quickly. It was packaged securely and came with a screen protector, block, and charging cable. All the buttons work and the battery life is great. The phone looks basically new except for a couple of scratches by the charging port (which are barely visible). The camera does not make the clicking noise! I will say buying a phone on Amazon is kinda hit or miss but I personally had a great experience."
1833,I recently switched back to iPhone from an android phone and even though the android was fantastic I had to return to Apple. The phone I received was in brand new condition and the battery life was @100%. I have the seller a 5 star rating and will order again in the future.
1834,"I got lucky and got one absolutely perfect on the outside! Not a scratch anywhere. The battery life is at 96%. No problems anywhere else either. I would have heard about it if any problems as my daughter has been on it 24x7 (I didn't tell her it was ""renewed"" :-)... Also bought cheap tempered glass screen protectors, a nice real-leather wallet case, and a Ankar wireless charging stand at same time for a nice birthday package for her. I am personally very happy with this ""renewed"" phone with the cost savings and quality!"
1835,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Soooo worth the money. it came in a generic box with a non apple charger and some warranty and return info. the phone itself is in nearly perfect condition with no scratches and just a little dirt around the camera which is nothing. battery capacity is at 93% which is really good it lasts me a whole day without charging it! i had no problem transferring my sim card either. thank you very much to the seller!
1836,"El producto con envio rapido llego en una semana a Chile. El iphone sin detalles de ralladuras y la bateria en 96% de vida. Totalmente recomendado. De hecho compre uno blanco tambien, este si vino con un detalle en un borde pero 100% funcional y con vida de bateria de 89%."
1837,88% max battery capacity
1838,Love this phone !!!  Only took 4 days to arrive and looked like new! What a step or2 up from my 6 plus. My husband likes it better than his Xs now. There were a lot of bad reviews glad I ignored them. Don’t be scared take the plunge!
1839,"Id say pay the extra money for premium it really makes you feel better about the purchase because let’s be honest Amazon refurbishment for iPhones isn’t the best and it backs you up through and through if your not satisfied and if there’s any issues with the phone I basically got mine brand new but almost, it had 96% battery life but I had no issues with it"
1840,"Screen was perfect besides very light scratches on the notch (barely noticeable unless you angle it) and small scratches on the back, also, my battery health was on 90% when received. Overall good buy!"
1841,"I will update this as time goes on, but upon receiving my phone it seems nearly brand new."
1842,"I was leery of ordering a phone online but I am very pleased.  The phone looks brand new, no scratches whatsoever and the battery seems to be great!  It didn’t come with an Apple charger but for the price and the condition, I don’t care!  Overall, very pleased.  I had an IPhone 6 which I loved but the camera was horrible and I am more than pleased with the camera on this phone!  I was on the fence but trust me, this phone was worth every penny I paid!"
1843,"Y’all! This phone is fabulous!! I cannot say it enough. There were minor scratches on the back that aren’t super noticeable, which they said could be a thing, so not surprised. The battery was at 90% when we got it. Turned on right away, runs really well and no lag. Plus it came with a phone case and a screen protector! Seriously, SO happy! And couldn’t be more thankful"
1844,"Works like a brand new phone, battery life is amazing, and it was delivered super quick!"
1845,Came just as said it’s an authentic Apple iPhone my only problem is that while yes I was aware it refurbished which is fine it’s clear they didn’t replace the battery and so it only fully charged to 88% it also doesn’t seem to charge pass 67% sadly I probably wouldn’t of ordered it knowing this. The charging port also is dirty almost looks corroded.
1846,The camera crackles when I am using it taking a picture. But I like the phone. My first iPhone did not expect the cracklings when I take a photo.
1847,"great phone that was practically brand new when i bought it ! i’ve had it since october 11 and waited exactly 2 months to write the review. it still works perfectly. however, if you have sprint - it can be more difficult to set this phone up. i had to take it to the sprint store and get a new sim card activated in order to use this phone."
1848,Excellent condition
1849,Its all good love all the features
1850,"The phone is in great condition and there was no scratch marks on the screen, but there was a few marks on the top and bottom and the battery life is 89% still a good phone."
1851,The battery needs to be replaced
1852,"Came in good condition, however there was slight damage from shipping but was not noticeable. After 2 days of usage, the battery health went from 100 to 96. The phone can overheat easily which caused the battery to weaken. But, everything else is perfectly fine. I highly recommend this phone since it was very cheap and worth the money."
1853,Es grande buenas fotos y tiene  me encanta
1854,"This is my second ""renewed"" phone purchase and so far so good.  Phone came in perfect condition and took only minutes to transfer data from old iphone to this new one and activate!  My only ""slight"" disappointment was 88% battery life but this was within the range posted in the listing."
1855,"I think it's a pretty good buy,phone works good  the only thing is the charger I think the one they sent was defective because after one week I had to change it"
1856,Great quality. Great price.
1857,"This phone is in perfect condition and works amazing I just received it yesterday I will give updates after a month!  I did verify that it is real, it came with the battery capacity of 91 which is good. This seller also sent a screen protector and a heavy duty case! I am more then pleased so far with the new phone."
1858,Well pricedGreat condition
1859,"This phone was received it great condition, quickly, & just as described. I've used iPhones & Android. I have likes & dislikes for each. I'm just a normal person, not at ""techie"" level, but Apple makes it waaay too difficult to download ringtones! That is why I gave it 4 stars."
1860,Muy buen estado los articulos
1861,"Will update in a few months, so far, so good."
1862,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Okay, first I want to say that I decided not to send the phone back because I didn’t feel like waiting for another one.. I have not given the seller a chance to rectify. On that note, the phone is beautiful. It looks as it is pictured. Although, it is a RENEWED phone. The screen may have been improperly installed. It goes crazy a few times in the hour, but for the most part it works. It’s not unbearable.. just aggravating especially for the money. It did come fully unlocked and ready to go. The charger was generic but it was pretty new."
1863,"excelente equipo, visualmente muy bien cuidado y desbloqueado de todo. excelente compra"
1864,It's my daughter's phone. She's 14 and loved it. She never knew it was a Amazon renewed phone. Came looking brand new. It should.be if you ask me for that price. But if you buy from eBay for that price there is always a ding somewhere. I always buy Amazon renewed phones
1865,"This phone was amazing! I was quite skeptical of purchasing this phone because it wasn’t completely new but the phone came in great condition!! It came with a few scratches around the back camera but other than that I loved it, it works completely new and the battery life is 90%. Happy customer :)"
1866,What I like about the phone is it was everything I was looking for I had been wanting an XR for a long time and was very scared to purchase one on amazon  cause the price was too good to be true but my phone came in good condition no  scratches at all I was very pleased  and impressed  with the phone i use it as my personal phone
1867,Every phone I hav ever ordered has been refurbished because honestly there is no need to spend full price. The phone is beautiful I got the iPhone XR in yellow and it is so pretty the phone came in great condition there was a few scratches on the bottom part of the screen but since I put a screen protector on it you can’t even tell it was easy to set up and I checked the battery life and it said at 90% so that’s not that bad overall I am very impressed and am in love also I ordered through JemJem
1868,"The phone works like new. The battery life was at 91%, which isn’t bad but it means I’ll have to get another battery put in sooner than normal. The switch on the side of the phone that silences the phone is broken still. It’s stuck on silent which I will have to fix soon. Other than that everything is great."
1869,"I read alot of reviews before buying so I wanted to review to help others. I bought this phone for my daughter. It was in perfect condition. No scratches or scuffs. Screen was perfect. She has been using it for a few days now, and no issues.Selling point for me was the 90 day return policy - just in case something was wrong with it."
1870,Amazing! like new everything!
1871,Great product in reasonable price. Highly recommend.
1872,"I was a little nervous about the possibility of getting a screen that had some noticeable scratches (per the description of refurbished items), but it looked like new! Works great in every other respect as well, though I can't personally comment, since I use Android -- this was a gift for my daughter."
1873,it’s literally a brand new phone not a single scratch in sight not i. the screen or back or side frame battery max cap was 97% which is great for me and even tho u can still replace it for like $70 at bestbuy still better than paying a full price for a new iphone definitely worth every single penny i paid 10/10
1874,It seems to be good! But had trouble not being able to create a new Apple ID said been done to many times! But all got do go online!
1875,"Screen is decent, not great.  Battery life is ok, but not as good as you would expect with an iPhone.  Passwords is terrible.  Facial recognition is for Philip K. Dick and the Chinese government. I bought it because iPhone’s only work in my car for streaming music. The lightning connector does not work very well and streaming and charging via the lightning goes is hit or miss.  It is just an okay phone, it doesn’t make me happy and cost a fortune."
1876,This phone is very easy to use and I got quite an upgrade since my last iPhone was a 7!  It is so wonderful not having to push a home button.  Swiping up is so much better!  Plus the battery on this phone lasts longer than my iPhone 7.  Very happy with this phone!
1877,"The price was right and the phone was like new.  However, the camera didn't function and although we bought the warranty, it was just cheaper to have it repaired locally and pay out of pocket rather than send it back and wait for it's return.  It was bought for my grand-daughter as a gift and after having the camera fixed she is happy."
1878,The product arrived with a big issue! It doesn't work.
1879,"I ordered 2 iPhone XR's and they came a day early! Both are in like new condition. One of the XR's came with a very, very small scratch at the upper left corner of the phone, but other than that, I'm totally satisfied. They even came with screen protectors! I was using an iPhone 5 and 6 before and the upgrades was long overdue. I'm always hesitant when it comes to purchasing things online, but was relieved when everything came as advertised. Will buy from this seller again."
1880,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I purchased this phone a little over a week ago. This phone has been amazing so far. There are no problems with it. The only imperfections are minor dings on the aluminium frame and some scuffing on the screen that is only visible when the phone is off. Over all I recommend it. 4.5/5
1881,"I had doubts before the purchase but now I am glade for the choice.The phone looks like new. No scratches or sign that was used before. It came with 90% battery even was just renewed. The sound is great, it has no issue. Everything works fine. I checked and it’s fully unlocked.The charger and the cable are not original as the seller specified in description."
1882,Physical condition of the phone is good however the battery life is not great. Overall phone is good and I haven’t faced any issue with the phone.
1883,"great iphone & really like the coral color just wish it came with more protection like a simple cover and or case for how expensive it was plus the screen had minor scratches on it where it wasn’t covered by the screen protector. overall satisfied, thanks amazon!"
1884,"I will admit, the packaging and presentation wasn’t there and I was scared of receiving a cracking or non-functional iPhone. I was wrong. The phone came in very good condition and isn’t very slow at all. But, there’s always a but. I received MY phone with a 93% battery health. It doesn’t affect me too much but it’s worth mentioning. You also won’t get headphones with the phone. I received MY phone with an off brand Roku lightning charger. Overall, I was very happy with my order."
1885,It’s perfect the battery last longer than expected can go almost two days with out charging it
1886,"Nice little iPhone with plenty of speed ,good camera quality and fast Wi-Fi connection."
1887,"I love the phone, it’s prettty nice upgrade from my 6s. The only issue I have is that it had a dent in the frame, but it was very minimal and didn’t take away from the look of the phone. Looks virtually brand new"
1888,"Mi mayor preocupación era que no este desbloqueado, pero ya le puse mi chip de Argentina y funciona lo más bien. La batería al 92%. Tiene algunas marcas pero tal cual aclara amazon renew, a la distancia de un brazo extendido casi ni se ven, de hecho son visibles porque es rojo, creo que en un modelo gris/blanco ni se verían. Estoy conforme por ahora, veremos con funciona cuando pasen los días!"
1889,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Everything looks perfect except for the back camera sometimes it vibrates and I’m not sure why it’s quite annoying though
1890,"This is the first renewed phone I have ever bought on Amazon or anywhere. This phone feels and looks brand new. I would never have known it was refurbed. Not a single scratch or dent, powered up perfectly and works great. I have nothing negative to say about this phone. I am glad I bought this here and gave it a chance and didn't end up spending my whole life savings on a new one."
1891,I never write reviews but I am going to about this phone. I was in desperate need for a phone and I was extremely skeptical about buying one online. I received this phone today and it is in 100% perfect condition. So far there has not been a single issue. I highly recommend.
1892,"This phone is great 👍🏾 it arrived ahead of schedule it was securely boxed and sealed no scratches or dings. Thus far the batter life is good, camera takes clear picture perfect pics the setup was very easy and the phone looks good in the case! This is a good phone for the price, so don’t hesitate to buy one! 👍🏾 If anything should change in the next 30 days my review will change."
1893,Awesome phone after having an iPhone 7 since like 2015.But I totally thought coral meant orange and whenever I buy things on amazon I see the colors off when online but when it arrives I see what it really looks like. I definitely have a pink phone now...
1894,"i was almost scared away by the bad reviews, but i’m glad i ignored them! phone is in perfect condition; it didn’t even have any cosmetic imperfections, which i wasn’t expecting! i looked it up the imei number to make sure it wasn’t stolen because a lot of reviews claimed theirs were, but it came back completely clean! works great with my carrier, no complaints!"
1895,"Estaba casi nuevoLa pantalla con rayones leves que solo se ven buscándolos detenidamente, el borde de la cámara con unos pequeños golpes pero en general todo lo demás estaba bienNi polvo ni nada en las entradas del cargador ni las bocinasLa batería estaba a un 91%Pero en general todo bienMi vendedor fue ChubbysMobile"
1896,"Works well was a little dirty when I got it. There was makeup in the creases, in the SIM card pop out etc. not ideal but did not seem to effect performance."
1897,We bought these phones (Renewed Premium) in coral for our granddaughters for Christmas. I was so pleased when I opened the box for each phone. They came nicely packaged and look brand new. To say these girls were thrilled is an understatement! The price was also better than any we found elsewhere and I like the fact that Amazon backs them with a year warranty.
1898,Was hesitant at first but I received a white XR and it was pretty much immaculate condition a little scratch by the speaker barely noticeable. It’s a used phone so it’s expected. This company also hooks you up with a very nice protective case and a screen protector with a lighting charger. I’m impressed at the quality of the great customer satisfaction they are trying to achieve 10/10
1899,"Todo esta perfecto completamente perfecto, pero vino con un gran defecto, el auricular se escucha muy bajo... es dificil contestar una llamada o una nota de voz... de resto esta perfecto. pero que mal eso del auricular."
1900,I was a little scared to buy an unlocked iphone but then it was the BEST CHOICE i made! I love it very much and there was no cracks; it basically came brand new. Comes only with a charger. The battery capacity is 87% but that’s normal because it’s a renewed phone. Buy this iphone guys you won’t regret it ☺️☺️💗
1901,Turned out great. Very nicw phone
1902,The phone works absolutely perfect and how it should be brand new. But there are some messed up pixels on the screen that appear on a black background. But overall it works great.
1903,Better than I expected
1904,"I was sooooo worried about this purchase. Going from Samsung to apple, this was a great switch. I have att service, was able to switch over SIM cards without going to att store. Phone came in excellent shape. Few scuffs on back of phone but I use a case 24/7 so this was no big deal for me. I have no complaints about this purchase. So each and fast shipping. Would recommend!"
1905,Just want to say i love this phone! I purchased this phone because i was having issues with another  unlocked phone and every since i placed this phone onto my service i have been having the most  excellent signal! No issues and the phone does not get hot while charging and on facetime! And the white color is growing on me lol!
1906,Just had my first heart attack when I found out my daughter had bought this. Damn what a hit on my wallet. But non the less great product
1907,"i'm happy i bought this phone from this seller, they shipped it as fast as they could and the phone is perfect. only issue it that my battery life is 97% but it did say that in the description and still lasts long! definitely a good choice to buy this phone and very affordable compared the apple and other sellers"
1908,"Didn’t realize it came with a screen protector, so that’s a plus. Minus the fact that it has a hardly noticeable little scratch near the USB port it’s a great phone! Basically a new iPhone for cheaper lol. One thing that irritates me is the charger and the block, they both aren’t by apple nor does it come with headphones. Other than that I recommend"
1909,"After I purchased the phone it was shipped in the morning and arrived very quickly, as it only took 3 days to arrive. The phone has no scratches or dents, the battery came with 98% capacity and the seller also included a free charger. The phone also worked perfectly fine with my SIM card. Overall, very fast shipping and great quality."
1910,Very pleased with my iPhone XR
1911,"WARNING: THE IPHOKE I GOT WAS NOT UNLOCKED, and it was locked with cricket/AT&T. Other than that the phone is great but I’m going to have to change my plan in order to use the phone. Not the most disappointing thing but I wish it was unlocked. Good Phone though."
1912,I was a little nervous after reading some reviews but I received my device early and I gotta say I absolutely love my new phone. There is no defects at all and looks like a new device the battery health was at 98% and didn’t have any problems setting up my device. It was completely unlocked like they said in the description. It’s completely worth buying.
1913,The phone is in perfect shape and works perfect!!!!
1914,Dude !!! I was literally second guessing buying this phone because of the reviews I’ve seen but literally it is like a brand new iPhone. No visible scratches anywhere (and trust me I have searched ) no glitching. Battery life charges quickly and last me the entire day ! And the touch screen works perfectly !! And the price is MUCH cheaper! Plz get this phone I strongly recommend it !!
1915,Stupid phone spazzes and clicks on different things as if the phone has a mind of its own. I had to buy a phone from Walmart. Same phone for less too. I should have went to Walmart first.
1916,"This phone was amazing! I got this as a gift from my parents :) it has no scratches, cracks, or anything wrong with it! It also came with a charger which I didn’t expect"
1917,"When i got ordered this Item i was only looking at the 1 star reviewed. so i was VERY Hesitant o buy it at first, but WOW This 3rd party, just wow.  the phone has 97% battery life. no cracks, very cleaned, even came with a screen protector and a charger and case. no issues what so ever! buy from them"
1918,"Todo muy bien, exelente pantalla, ningun rayon o tayon en ningun lado, bateria al 94% .....exepto por el entrego, estaba para tal dia y segun si llego, despues se actualizo la notificacion en la app dandome la noticia que no se habia entregado....bla bla bla... al final llego 8 dias despues de la fecha que la compania habia dicho"
1919,Phone has too many scratches on back and even battery health is only 89%. It doesn’t look like new phone. Was expecting much better phone based on reviews.
1920,No complaints! Came with no scratches at all
1921,Looks and feels new.
1922,"This is not a scam at all. My phone works well. When I receive it it had no scratches or dents.  The only downside is that the battery is slightly used so is not going to last as long as you would with a new phone. But for a renewed phone this is incredibly. Also, people if you have a problem take advantage of this service right away and change it and fully read instructions. This is not a new phone so of course there is not going to be an original charger or headphones. Read instructions!!!"
1923,"Very happy with phone, no issues."
1924,I was a little iffy on buying the phone but I needed a new one due to problems with one I had just got and I love this phone! It came about a week earlier than estimated date from Amazon and there is nothing wrong with it. I would definitely buy again. It is not a scam like some people say. Took it into my carrier the day it came in the mail and had no problems seeing it up at all!
1925,"Bought 2 phones for the office.  One was fine, good battery and screen, fully functional.  The second had screen replace - looked ok, but they didn't re-enable the display True Tone feature.  OK, I'll live with that.  Then tried to charge it over the next couple days, would not get over about 75%, and dropped fast.  Nope, that's a defective battery - won't hold a charge.  Requested return; only if I pay for return shipping to Verizon.  Not the Amazon return process, must pay USPS $8 for return shipping - not free.  They'll evaluate and decide - we'll see..."
1926,Great in all caterigories
1927,"Few minor dings and scratches, none on the screen. Phone works well only complaint is battery health is at 88%. Not happy about that was hoping for the money spent it would be higher."
1928,Great product....
1929,
1930,"The phone gets really hot if you are using it extensively or if keep it in a case while charging. It has good features, especially with the iPhone update. When I got it the battery life was only at 85 percent. It holds the charge well enough though!"
1931,"I bought an iPhone XR fully unlocked, at first I thought that the phone was not unlocked I took it to my carrier and they told me that it was still locked, I was so mad but then I took it to my carrier again but different store an they told me that it was good to go, and I was are you serious I couldn't believe it. What happened was that the guy from the first store was in training 🤪.I love the iPhone XR its it's really good ."
1932,I liked that the shipping was fast and that the phone came very well boxed and wrapped! I was skeptical about purchasing a refurbished phone off line but this experience has changed my mind completely! I received the phone about a month ago and so far so good!! I’m happy with this purchase!
1933,"OK, I admitted that I was not confident when placed the order and expected that I may return it. However, I am wrong. When received the phone, I was so happy that I made the order. The phone is like new (well, I will say it is new), not one scratch is found, no deficit is found. Battery life so far is good. Well, just can't complain about it."
1934,"I bought the iPhone XR, Coral, 64GB for my mom around September of last year from Chubbiestech. The phone works great, the battery life is outstanding, and the camera quality is amazing! My mom is very happy with the phone and I just wanted to thank the peeps at Chubbiestech for doing a wonderful job on her phone! Y’all rock!"
1935,the only thing that’s wrong is it won’t read my SIM card it’s unlocked to any carrier but my SIM card won’t work it in it . other than that really good quality .
1936,I’ve been using this phone for about 3 weeks and I’m so happy! I really wanted to upgrade from my iPhone 6 but all the phones at Apple were $600+. I decided to try amazon renewed and I’m so happy with my purchase. The phone I got is a beautiful blue color and the cameras are amazing. My phone came in pretty much perfect condition and the battery capability was at 100%. The iPhone XR is a great phone that speaks for itself and I’m very please with buying it refurbished on amazon. Such a great deal.
1937,"I recommend getting this phone. It works. It also comes with a case, screen protector, and a charger but no headphones. I regret getting it in white, if you really want it in a color just spend the extra couple of dollars it’s seller for, if that’s the case. (no scratches, smudges, or smears) I’m not really good at making these reviews, so I hope this helps."
1938,I am satisfied
1939,Basically like new. I got this phone for my partner because I have the same phone and they needed a new one in a bit of a rush. The phone works just like new. No complaints this way. I would get another one in the future instead of paying full price with the phone company.
1940,"It is what it is supposed to be.  No issues with the phone or setting it up.  Unlocked, updated, set up, no problems."
1941,Good condition
1942,Good
1943,"I was debating wether or not to even get the iPhone to begin with but It ended up working out nicely. for the negative customers they probably made sum sort of mistake on there end because in all honesty it happens. doesn't mean the seller won't help you out, there trying to make money. I had no problems an I recommend this seller because people don't appreciate like they use to, an I appreciate this phone very much. word of advise for other customers. just read the descriptions, make sure you know what your buying before you do."
1944,"Buen equipo, buena batería ningún detalle visible, El cargador es genérico e igual incluyeron un estuche y vidrio templado que se agradece es un buen detalle por parte del vendedor"
1945,"iPhone XR arrived very protected, so far everything is working good. The battery Health was 88%, witch is why the 4 star rating. My iPhone 8plus is at 86% and it’s 4 years old."
1946,"I like that it was delivered much quicker than I expected. Even better it came just as I wanted and was delivered by hand not mailbox! But what I loved most was the options on this, I got what I wanted a yellow 64gb xr completely clean. To those looking at reviews this is a trust worthy place to buy a phone."
1947,I’m definitely ordering again came a day early and my husband love it
1948,I’ve had my yellow iPhone XR for a month and a half. I wanted to wait to see if anything comes up as surprise but the phone is working well like brand new looks brand new and I’m very happy with it. Idk about the charger cause when I used it something was wrong and it wasn’t charging my phone but I didn’t try again I just used my other charger. Very successful purchase and arrived earlier than expected!
1949,I was actually very hesitant to get this phone I had seen some neg reviews that kind of threw me off but there where much more positive reviews I like everything about it. It didn’t come with not a single or dent and all my data moved in less than 10 mins it was a smooth transition from the 6 to the XR but I am very much pleased with the result. The max capacity was at 98%which in my eyes is great coming from a 74%.It also came a day early. Must buy!!!
1950,"The phone has minor wear as it's refurbished, but once we put up the case, it looks brand new. The good thing is, it works like brand new, and that's more important. Everything works great and fast. Good purchase!"
1951,One of the best purchases on Amazon so far love my new phone!!
1952,"The replacement phone has definitely exceeded all expectations. Product arrived in excellent condition and it is looked brand new.  It was super easy to upload all of my contacts, apps, etc.  Maybe 15 minutes maximum.I am extremely pleased with the service and will use it again and recommend to my friends and family."
1953,"Was very easy to get a SIM card for it, works really good for $300 and it’s fully unlocked and it belongs to you no monthly payments."
1954,Todo funciona perfectamente. Ninguna diferencia con otros iPhones compraría nuevos.
1955,both phone's looked brand new with no flaws. battery's were at 89 and 90 percent when received.  we have had them about a week now and are so happy we purchased them. there were quite a few mixed reviews but we had a very pleasant experience with ours.
1956,Phone works great!
1957,"Came in good condition, everything so far has been working perfectly."
1958,"At first I was pretty scared to buy this due to the few bad reviews that I found, but I’m so glad that I still got it!! 10/10 recommend buying this phone! I upgraded from an 6s to an XR and I’ve never been happier! This phone is super fast and the battery is amazing, it’s like going to the Apple store and getting a new one right of the shelf! Completely in love with it, and delivery came right on time with everything needed. :)"
1959,"The cellphone that was delivered to me was EXACTLY as described. It looked brand new. The facial recognition works perfectly,  I couldn’t ask for a better battery life and the screen quality is perfect for when I stream movies"
1960,I was skeptical ordering this from amazon but overall the phone is great. My only issue is my  phone arrived with minor scratches on the screen. Besides that the phone works like new
1961,FuncionaMuy bien como nuevo sin ningún golpe alrededor
1962,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus and this phone is amazing! O & M Wireless provided all the information that I needed to successfully transfer my data. The phone even arrived 3 days “ahead of schedule”! This all is even better than I hoped. The phone looked like new as did the charger. I am glad that I purchased this phone from this company.
1963,"My son saved up his money for months to buy this phone. He loves it, it’s a good phone and it has survived a lot being that my son is 12!  And I love that he bought it himself... : ) Seriously, not because I don’t want to spend my money, but because it’s teaching him that money doesn’t grow on trees and sometimes you have to wait to get what you want!! He is also learning how expensive things truly are! Great life lessons all around!"
1964,I don’t really give reviews but I do want to say that the phone is in almost perfect shape and there were no cracks or scratches and I was very skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but I couldn’t pass of the price overall I am very impressed
1965,"Shipped and received quick, no disappointments thus far."
1966,"So far so good however it’s different than my iPhone 6 Plus my iPhone 7 Plus the iPhone 8 it works totally different so it’s a whole new device to learn from me which I know it’s OK but I wish I could just learn it like a three-year-old other than that I highly recommend it! In addition you can call Apple at anytime and they will help you with any questions you have.So now it is January 14,2020 and I have my Apple XR about 35 days : ) every new day I LOVE IT MORE & MORE!!!!!"
1967,It gets glitchy sometimes and the camera came cracked. It was an okay buy but I definitely think you could probably find a better one somewhere but I was desperate 🤷🏽‍♀️
1968,"I was looking for something pretty, lightweight and has protection when I drop my phone.  I’m thinking I’ll get a few more so I can a variety of colors and designs to go with my wardrobe.  Since there not bulky and very easy to to switch out might as well have some fun with the many patterns available."
1969,This phone was perfect out of the box.  No scratches. No dings. Nothing.  Transferred my stuff at the store and it works perfectly running iOS 15
1970,I chose this over a new iPhone. Much better deal.
1971,"I bought the black iPhone from Chubbiestech. It came clean with a charger, cable, and hard screen protector I can apply myself. It looks almost new.There's a small shallow scratch across the top of the screen which I notices during my initial inspection but I haven't noticed it since then. I've been using this for over 2 weeks now.The battery says it's at 94% health but it fully charged and lasts forever. I have had 0 issues. I'm very pleased with what I received and would order from them again."
1972,As expected
1973,The phone came in without and damage. It was unlocked to. One of my favorite purchases on Amazon!
1974,Everything was perfect not to mention tempered glass!!
1975,This phone came in literally perfect condition there was one small dot on the turn on button would was not a deal breaker and could be covered with a case! The battery life could be better but again it’s a renewed phone which is not bad! Overall everything is working perfect and would 100% recommend buying this phone!
1976,This was the Christmas gift.  when it arrived and set up The rear camera was not working. I contacted the solution center and we walk through a few steps to resolve the issue. We ended up returning the phone and they sent back a replacement that works perfectly fine. five stars because I couldn’t have asked for better service.
1977,"Received in two days, looks just like you just bought new!! Works great on AT&T!! Highly recommend this phone and seller!!!!! Definitely buy from this seller again!!"
1978,"Before I had purchased the iPhone XR, my attention was completely grab by the key words of “Fully Unlocked” was stated inside of the product description. Which helped me decide on choosing the iPhone XR, because the true definition of “Fully Unlocked” means to be compatible with every phone service. Unfortunately after going to every phone store around my neighborhood, I learned that the phone was clearly falsely advertised and was only compatible with T-Mobile & not with my BOOST Mobile plan..Regardless Synergy phone selling company was understanding of my situation and gave me a full refund 24 hours later. So based on them giving me a quick refund I’m gonna give them an extra star rating..Btw they forget to mention their phones don’t come with SIM cards installed."
1979,Had a few scratches but awesome
1980,It keeps heating
1981,Phone was in a very good condition. As expected.
1982,"The battery life lasts me all day. The screen was flawless. No signs of wear, no scratches, looked brand new. It’s very fast and works great! I love the color (Blue) and I love everything about it. No regrets! Great deal on a great phone! And for those wondering, it’s an actual Apple iPhone, I love it!"
1983,"It was a pleasure doing business with this seller. Product was shipped and arrived quickly and was exactly as described. My sister and I got this phone for our mother as a mother's day gift, and she has not told us of any issues to date. Fantastic product!"
1984,Everything thing is high quality
1985,"I was a little worried but it came perfect, not a single scratch that i can see. Feels brand new and works perfectly. It does only come with its charger, but that's all it said it came with so no need to complain. Overall good purchase do not regret it. ( side note it came much earlier than expected which is also a plus! :))"
1986,At first I was super worried due to all the negative comments but so far the phone is perfect looks brand new came with phone case and screen protector free and it has 87% battery it’s perfect after a new months I’m going to update to let everyone know it’s it lasted longer then some people said and it’s also fully unlocked
1987,"Two of my teen sons spent their own money to upgrade from their iphone 6s and iphone 7 to an iphone XR through Amazon. Both phones arrived in pristine, like new condition. Much better than buying brand new. Who has that kind of money !?"
1988,"I bought two of these phones, one came without the chip tray, and the other does not keep the battery charge for a long time, and the seller's customer service is terrible, they never answer"
1989,"I haven’t yet connected it, but it seems excellent."
1990,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Bought this from the seller BMOF86ST. Phone came almost like new repackaged! One of my best experiences buying renewed devices from amazon!Speaking on the phone itself, using it for a few days I could hardly tell a difference between the iPhone 11 and the XR. Feels like the exact same phone minus one more camera. If you were considering buying this, I think you should go ahead! Solid buy!"
1991,"I was skeptical buying a refurbished phone but, it came a week early and it looks as of it's pretty much brand new! Job well done in my opinion."
1992,All my apps and data transferred easily but I still cannot use the phone because I can’t get my number transferred to it via SIM card.  My old SIM card is too big for the XR. I’m still trying to figure out how to get my number transferred.
1993,I bought this iPhone thinking it’s all new like the battery and the speakers and the ear speaker I can hardly hear in my ear speaker I wished it was fixed before I got this iPhone I bought it very expensive more than I can afford. I wish the battery health is 100% but it’s at 89% health. And one part of my phone get hot when I use it. But every thing else is great the camera and the touchscreen is the best
1994,I just got my phone and I am in love! I have always been a fan of apple.  This device is in pristine condition.  It came in the original Apple packaging and looked almost brand new! The only downside was that I didn't get any ear pods but thats ok I can always purchase.  It works like a dream.  No issue so far.  I also love the fact that I have a warranty which I never had before with my other apple devices I got from Amazon.  I am really happy with my purchase.
1995,Have been using my phone for a 1year and 9months and counting…
1996,Ordered this refurbished for my 13-year old. I upgraded him from an iPhone 6s. So far its been working great and I'm so glad I ordered despite some of the negative reviews. If you're looking for a decent phone and don't want to spend a lot of money this is the way to go!
1997,"so the phone is great overall but for some reason when i mute or turn my phone on silent, the shutter sound will still occur. and it’s only on snapchat and it’s extremely loud, like it won’t turn down at all. someone please help me because i don’t want to get rid of the phone."
1998,"Solid phone at a solid price. I upgraded from a 7, and I love it!"
1999,"Llamadas, videos y música se escuchan distorsionados. No hubo control de calidad en la certificación del producto"
2000,"The Phone came, very well Packaged, and on time. The Phone looks Brand Bew, not a Scratch or nothing on it. It looks like a Brand New Phone. I am very Happy with this Phone. It was unlocked, so I could use it with Straight Talk.I would Recommend this Phone to everyone, that’s looking for a iPhone XR."
2001,"The screen and buttons work perfectly. The face recognition feature works with no problem. However, my best take on this was the speaker volume I don’t know why it sound so loud and clear. I would recommend to anyone."
2002,"My wife needed a new phone.  We were wary with reviews and reading warnings that some phone could have an iTunes lock or other issues but there were no issues upon receipt.  There was no box, but we already knew that from the description.  It looked new with no scratches, dirt or other issues.  Everything worked fine, faceid had no issues as well as setting up the iCloud from her old phone."
2003,"Bought it as a present for a family member and they loved it as they transitioned from Huawei, but battery is not efficient.No Headphone jacks and doesn’t come in the original box. Charger is not an apple original charger.Overall the phones camera quality and processors are very good."
2004,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Pretty good phone for price. Few minor scratches on screen. But its definitely a good buy. Dont hesitate guys
2005,bought it for my little sister for her birthday present she loves it and it works perfectly to this day 10/10 would recommend .
2006,"The phone is not perfect, but is pretty good. There are hardly any noticeable scratches on the screen, on the frame. The phone has a battery capacity of 90%. I just plugged in my SIM card and it worked right away. Everything on the phone is functional. For the price I recommend it."
2007,This phone i got is terrible. The face id does not work. The phone came super dirty when i bought it with wax everywhere. When i call i cant here anything through the call audio speaker. and the charging port is either dirty or broken because the phone doesn't charge or wobbles the charger and disconnects every two seconds.  and the battery is trash as it has literally 80% battery life on the dot and fluctuates. The battery only lasts me like 3-4 hours at most.  What a piece of junk. Whoever inspected this phone needs another job because they suck at their job or are lazy.
2008,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I love it! It’s actually a gorgeous phone. The battery LASTS, the camera quality is amazing! Front AND back, and it genuinely comes with 128 GB, and unlocked. The only downside is the cheap charger but nothing to worry about, when you can purchase an original charger. In love. Definitely recommend."
2009,Needed to replace my iPhone. It was an affordable upgrade and had no problems activating at AT&T.
2010,"My main complaint is right at the corner it has some very noticeable damage, with that type of damage I fear one good drop my screen will start to crack. a few minor scratches on the touchscreen right in that area. The phone itself is in good working condition."
2011,"I was iffy about the purchase right after I ordered it but previous reviews kind of helped . After getting the phone the ONLY scratch is on the top but with my case on it isn’t visible ! The battery health is 94% , the phone works perfect !"
2012,"Honestly, they do have very very light scratches but they are amazing phones, you can’t tell unless you are really looking. Phones come in perfect and ready to activate just needed to put in the SIM cards from our old phones and bam done no issues what so ever and we ordered 4 of them"
2013,"Still learning how to use the IPhone XR , therefore I can’t give a good assessment."
2014,"I bought this renewed iPhone from Amazon, the top right screen has a line of crack and few scratches, it’s only in good but not excellent condition as described, I covered the scratches and the cracks with the screen protector but it still showed.I’m using it for now and if it has more other problems in the next 90 days, I will return it as Amazon allow this renewed item to be returned within 90 days."
2015,it had no scratches whatsoever and the battery life was 93
2016,I waited almost a whole year to make this review because I wanted to make sure that I was going to give you all the correct information. This phone rocks do not hesitate to purchase a phone from here. Almost a year later and I have not had any issues with my iPhone XR. Great Service and fast shipping
2017,problema de parlante
2018,"Battery life was at 90% ,the screen had no noticeable scratches ,back of the phone was super clean everything works fine.Chubbiestech is the seller and I will buy from them again. For under $400 it comes with a screen protector and a high quality clear case .I might not buy a new phone again lol thanks chubbietech"
2019,Power button didn’t work at all couldn’t lock phone or turn it off with power button
2020,Loved everything but there were a few nicks on the side of the phone. Not on the screen but around it. I used a sharpie to hide it but still....
2021,"Phone working very well, battery life is good as normal, I put the google fi and it’s working well, everything just working well, delivered on time, packaging was great."
2022,"I was skeptical about buying this phone considering the bad reviews but so far, this phone is a pretty good deal considering the low price. This phone is refurbished so it makes sense that it has a couple minor scratches on the front and back side of the phone. Nothing too major though.The battery life is also really good."
2023,"the phone is absolutely beautiful and not a single scratch nor crack. i love that it came with a case, screen protector and charger. the only down side is that its missing a screw on the bottom. not really too serious of an issue for me just wish it add a screw so i wouldnt have to have a little sticker saying void. all in all so clean and beautiful. definitely will buy again if im ever looking to upgrade."
2024,I got the iPhone XR red 64gb the sides were beat with paint gone and the back glass was very scratched.Update after one month later. After a series of messages I’ve been given a discount of $50 off the phone for said damages. I’m very pleased with a customer service!
2025,"When I first bought the phone I was super on edge on buying it from reading the reviews. when I got my phone in the mail today and opened it, it looked brand new! Yes there were small barley noticeable scratches on the screen. My battery percentage when I got it was at 43%. In all honesty though what do you expect from a refurbished phone. Definitely recommend though if your trying to save some money on buying a IPhone."
2026,"This phone is everything I needed. It met my expectations! Only a couple little scratches on the sides of the phone, and no scratches at all on the screen or back!!! It has 89% battery life (I checked) and just a great all in all phone. I was definitely a little worried when I read some of the reviews, but I’m totally not disappointed! Super happy! The camera quality is also great!"
2027,Very nice color. Battery Health was at 92%
2028,The screen lags.
2029,Phone worked fine.  No issues so far and we had it for a couple months.  Battery works good.
2030,"It’s a amazing phone, but you will have to get a SIM card and a service plan but other then that it’s a great phone:)"
2031,Very quick and exactly as described.
2032,"came in great condition , if it’s been used before you can’t even tell , it seems like it’s a brand new phone . no scratches/cracks , took the sim card i put in it with no problems , great camera quality. definitely recommend !!"
2033,"The phone came perfect, unlocked, the charger was cheap but I’m not complaining great purchase the phone works awesome! Very happy"
2034,"Little sketchy at first, but when product came it looked almost brand new, would highly suggest getting this for people looking for reliable phones"
2035,"Was really unsure about ordering but I took one for the team and I wasn’t disappointed. Honestly I had a hard time connecting it but that was a me problem not with the phone. It looks new tbh. Only thing that was a little scratched up is where the charger goes but it wasn’t like omg this looks horrible. Battery life is at 94%, came with a screen protector, a charger and cube(not apple but worked fine)"
2036,"I got this phone to hopefully be just as good as new, but no. It has times when it drops calls for no reason, exits from an app unexpectedly, will not allow for volume adjustment, and sometimes will not allow me to answer an incoming call. I didn't care that the air pods were not included (I knew from the product description and I already had some). I expected a scratch or two on the back glass (I use an Otter Box for drop protection anyway) so no big deal there either. I love the big screen and the high-quality camera. It would have been perfect if the annoying little quirks did not happen so frequently."
2037,Great value for the price paid - better than paying full price
2038,If you’re skeptical about buying this do not be. I bought this and it came within a few days I’m not gonna lie I was a little nervous. But it came in perfect condition battery at 95% life no cracks no scuffs. Also came with a screen protector on the phone and comes with a charger. Great deal for the price. it’s pretty much brand new 10/10
2039,i bought this and i don't regret it at all. battery life lasted me for 1 day and i used it for the whole day. camera quality is very good and the condition it came in was amazing. no scratches and it looked like it had not been touched at all. i have only had it for a couple so the performance might change but its been great so far and i really  recommend it!!
2040,This phone came sooner than expected and was super easy to track the package. The phone came unlocked and was super easy to setup. I set mine up through straight talk for $35 a month with the phone bought outright! Such a great deal! No damage at all to the phone. It came in perfect condition. Would recommend to anyone wanting a new phone at a great price!
2041,Phone broke from 1 drop and the phone was already like “modified” so the screen came off because someone superglued it from the previous owner
2042,"I’m using the new phone so I can’t take a picture of the phone, but the quality is very nice it’s like new it does have a little Scrapes but thats only because it’s a renewed phone. But overall I love it and the batter life is amazing the screen had no scratches I recommend buying from this reseller."
2043,Everything was great except that the microphone is a little muffled for videos recorded. Maybe I just got unlucky but be warned!
2044,"This deal was the best price I found on the internet without having a trade-in. Although it is a “renewed” item, it came in like new condition, and even came with a nice protective phone case and a screen protector! Also, it arrived 1 day earlier than expected, which was a pleasant surprise. Very happy with this purchase!"
2045,"I was a little skeptical about buying this phone but it’s honestly great! It was fully unlocked , the camera quality is great ,and mine came looking 100% new! Mine has no scratches or marks on it ! Honesty worth it if you’re trying to save money . Just know it doesn’t come with the original charger  nor does it come with earphones ! It says it in the description but most people don’t read it and act surprised when it doesn’t arrive with them."
2046,Stop working after 3 months.
2047,Looks like new. Easy and fast to move all of my stuff over from my 6+.
2048,This was for my daughter's 15th birthday. It arrived 4 days earlier than promised so that was a great start. Phone was 80% charged when it arrived. There were a couple very small scuff marks on the back but hardly noticeable. Touch screen worked wonderfully. Camera quality very good up to standard. All and all she is very happy with this purchase & so am I.
2049,looks and works  like new
2050,"Phone seems to be in good condition but it came locked :/ im assuming its not the company's fault and that someone opened the box but this is just rlly disappointing, hoping i can return this phone and switch it out for another one."
2051,The shipping time was great. The phone looks great no scratches or visible signs of wear. 90day return is what sold me.
2052,Everything works like new. 100% satisfied
2053,"I didn't like how it came with a tiny bit of scratches, but I like it it came with a charger it didn't break while shipping shipping was kinda slow and fast at the same time because of USPS. But everything is good."
2054,"Had this phone for over a month and everything works as expected. Really happy with it. I’ve never owned an iPhone but switching over from Android was an easy transition. Only issue with this phone, which may not be faulty of the actual phone or refurbishing company, is that I can’t  use headphones when making FaceTime calls. It’s very annoying, but oh well."
2055,It’s an awesome product but the battery life is not the best when it comes except for that it’s excellent
2056,"Screen QualityReally nice phone, except for screen. Because the supplier did not catch this defect, he sent me a “renewed” phone with a screen that was not flat. I know this because I have installed three different screensavers, and all have shown two quite-large air bubbles in the SAME PLACE, which cannot be smoothed out. With the screensavers removed, I can now see dents in the glass in those locations."
2057,"Everything was in great condition, the only thing wrong is the microphone does not work very well"
2058,"It is a great phone, so far. The quality of the image is good, it came in like-new condition, the battery doesn't last as much as i wanted but it's still ok."
2059,"I was beyond exited when I saw that the phone had no scratches on the screen. I was a little disappointed when I saw that the battery life of the phone was 90%, besides that I’m totally in love with the phone. At first I was very nervous because I had never purchased a phone for myself. Overall, not bad besides the battery life everything is amazing."
2060,"I was leery to purchase a refurbished (renewed) iPhone XR, but it only cost me $514 with tax and I needed a new phone. I received my iPhone quickly and it was in perfect condition. No scratches on the screen and no dents or scrapes on the exterior. I’m very pleased with the phone! All I needed to do was take my SIM card from my old phone and place it into my XR and I was good to go. I highly recommend purchasing from this buyer."
2061,Came early came with a charger very nice not cracks or scratches 10/10 Would recommend
2062,Sound doesn’t work. Have to put all calls on speaker.
2063,"Not one scratch on the back nor front. This was an easy transfer from my old one to this one. My whole layout and text messages from my old phone got transferred to my new one which was awesome. No glitches so far, no problems. This was a successful purchase by far. Also it came with a clear case!"
2064,A little glitchy at first but works better now
2065,"I love this phone. I received this January 2, 2020. This phone has been great to me. There is a tiny little scratch on the screen but u can’t barely see it and with a screen protector on it it disappears. It came with 97% battery capacity. It works great not a single problem with it hopefully it stays that way. The seller I bought it from was amazing and I highly recommend u buy this phone."
2066,Phone was without Even a scratch. Extremely satisfied.
2067,Came as advertised.  And a great price compared to new phone.  No noticeable blemishes or defects.
2068,"It’s a great phone and delivery was fast but my battery HEALTH was at 97% and not 100% not a big deal but has no scratches, blemishes or anything which is great :) came with headphones, and charger. Upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone XR and it was soooooo worth it ha and 64gb is more then enough space unless you never clear out your messages, internet, photos in the thousands. Games that takes up gbs then the 128 is good too but NOBODY NEEDS 256gb"
2069,100% worth buying !! It was delivered wayyyyy earlier than i expected no damages no issues absolutely nothing wrong with the phone at all ! All is worth buying this phone!
2070,Have not used face recognition
2071,Great has cause Me any problems
2072,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Nice 2nd hand iPhone , it works great ,  seller do a great job ,  There is  Free screen protector in box 📦  Important thing is battery is 100 ％ health"
2073,"just got my unlocked iphone today and it came earlier than expected, was package nicely & so far everything works perfectly! there were a couple of dents on the corners but for a used phone it’s expected, it’s brand new to me and doesn’t bother me, the screen was perfect & they even sent the sim card key to make things easier!! love it!!"
2074,"This is my first day with the phone but to be a renewed or refurbished phone it is a great phone, I have one small scrap on the top left edge and the screen is kinda scratched like the previous owner didn’t really believe in screen protectors also came with a mophie charger cable which impressed me so it’s a overall good phone and a great purchase"
2075,"I don’t like that this phone has face recognition instead of fingerprint. It has to be right in front of your face, not lying flat, and with a mask, it’s useless. I like the size and battery life. The screen is not like my older phone on this one, you often tap and tap. But it came with protective glass. I’m disappointed in the camera. The screen size for picture taking is quite a bit smaller than the frame of the phone. I’d return it if that was not such a hassle."
2076,No complaints. Would purchase from seller again.
2077,"I have only had it a couple of days.Looks like it is brand new, and seems to work just fine.I still need to use it some more to make sure everything is working.Going in to my 3rd week and it acts and looks like a new phone.Glad I got the larger 128 GB, now I don’t have to worry above downloading anythingLike it a lot."
2078,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 The phone came in perfect condition! Besides minor scratches that aren’t really visible. However, do not put this phone in water. The water seal on it is broken and it is no longer water resistant. I barely put my phone in the water and the screen had become water damaged. I was lucky that only my screen was water damaged and not the phone itself. I’ll be fixing the screen otherwise a great purchase!"
2079,"I think this is the best refurb product I've ever received.  If it weren't in a generic box with the loose wrapping, it could pass as brand new.  I've been using it for several hours and i can find no issues, and no evidence that it has even been touched by a human being.  Wish all refurb products were this good."
2080,"The phone came in excellent condition with no scratches or cracks. I’ve had it for about two weeks now and it works amazing. I will say if you are under t-mobile and having trouble with the sim, call your care provider first to activate the sim on the phone! you can’t just put it in and go. The phone arrived in a timely manner and i’ve definitely recommended the purchase to others."
2081,I am not happy
2082,"me switching from a 7 to a XR it's gonna take some getting used to but so far so good!! great phone great quality. it was fully unlocked i popped my sim in and it instantly connected!! WELL WORTH THE MONEYUpdate: It's been well over a year, phone still in good condition. Everything still functioning just like new. Seriously don't hesitate buy it, you won't be upset"
2083,Me encanto estoy feliz con mi teléfono
2084,Real deal. Nice nice. Everything is fine with it the only thing I noticed is when I received it it had two little scratch marks on the screen. Other then that it’s fine
2085,I ordered this phone after reading al the reviews and when receiving mine I was in utter shock. First off the phone was FLAWLESS. Like brand new!!! On top of that my battery life was at 99% unlike other reviews. I really recommend this product and super excited of such a nice phone for half the price.
2086,Like
2087,Products was as described A+
2088,At first I was scared to get the phone because  some of the reviews weren’t good but I gave it a chance and my phone is perfect and I’m happy I upgraded. I’ve had my phone for a few months now got it turned on and it’s been the best.
2089,I am extremely happy with this purchase!! It arrived on time. It was in perfect condition! Not a single mark on it. Screen quality was perfect. We have had it for over a month now and have not had one single issue. We actually bought another one. So glad I took the chance!
2090,Came during expected shipping with no scratches or marks it didn’t come with an apple charger but that wasn’t a problem since i have one already. i got the phone a couple weeks ago and it works great. it took a while to get it set up but i’m sure that was because i wasn’t on wifi connection.
2091,So every store had the xr but no red I’ve had my phone for a month now and I loveeee it the picture quality is AMAZING the battery lasts all day with power saving mode on and I love the new specs of this phone I would definitely recommend this phoneUPDATE: it’s currently October 2022 and I STILL have my phone 😭 it recently just feel ALL THE WAY in the toilet but it’s still going strong I would DEFINITELY get my upgrade from This seller
2092,Bought this phone for a friend overseas and he loves it.  Great buy for a good price!
2093,It came and look perfect and I came with a screen protector on it and I took it off because I had bought a really nice one for it and as soon as I took it off I saw tons and I mean tons of scratches. It’s kinda sad that the put the screen Procter to hide the scratches 1/10 would never buy from them in a million years
2094,"Very good phone even tho it’s used. The battery life is good it’s at 89% it doesn’t die quickly. I bought phone on Monday and it came on Wednesday which was very fast shipping. The phone also came with a really good phone case,glass screen protector, and a phone charger so it’s worth the money I suggest buying from here.😊"
2095,"Phone came and worked instantly on Verizon, phone has no visible scratches at all. Face ID works flawlessly as well as everything else I have tried so far. Battery health came at 86% and so far the battery life is still good. Also amazingly fast shipping."
2096,I liked everything about the phone its just the battery life the phone came with no scratches the phone came with 75% battery.
2097,"phone came perfect. One complaint is only the screen protector, kinda sucks, I’d take it off and get a better one"
2098,I just got it today and i’m in love!!
2099,Selfie camera distorts photos…completely foggy looking!Waiting for seller to reply…
2100,"It works well, and feels brand new. (I’m writing this review on it lol)"
2101,"I got the fully unlocked blue iPhone XR. It is in pristine condition. This is my first ""renewed"" pone but I would definitely go for it again. It comes with all accesories in like new condition and it is in fact fully unlocked. I travel a lot for work and have used it all over the world with different providers with no problema whatsoever. It DOES NOT come in a Factory box so just be aware. It comes in a similar box labeled Amazon renewed so think about it if this is important to you. In my case, I gave it a shot and I am truly impressed. Look no further."
2102,"Worried about this purchase to say the least. When I opened the Amazon box I saw a scrappy phone box but it was packaged well to protect the phone. The charger is off brand but works well. That’s all the slightly negative out of the way.I turned the phone on, works like new, 96% battery health and the glass is pretty much perfect. For the price, I’d definitely buy again."
2103,I was a little skeptical at first ordering a phone from amazon especially a refurbished one at that. I ordered the phone Tuesday  and said it will arrive Friday but it actually was delivered Wednesday (the day after I ordered). I was surprised it came that fast. Phone works perfectly feels like new. Didn’t come in original box or have original accessories but that’s okay with me. Highly recommend. I got the XR blue 256gb
2104,Great value
2105,Nice phone. I love it
2106,                    The media could not be loaded.                 My phone came in brand new I say it doesn’t even look refurbished. Battery life came in at 96% very surprising. So far the phone has been working great am very happy with my purchase. Although it did arrive 5 days late but I’m not complaining.
2107,
2108,"This phone is in perfect operating condition. Face recognition works great, all the features work great and battery life gets up to 100%. I could not be happier with the seller and I couldn’t be happier with my iPhone XR."
2109,Overall a good phone for the price. It does occasionally glitch but no cracks or dents. Does what I need it to do.
2110,"I like the color and the battery life was 90%. I like the color so I got coral. I ordered it on July 10th and the phone came on July 15. Heads up the packaging came with a charger, screen protector and the phone in a white non generic box. I was hesitant of buying because of the price, but I’m lucky I took the risky, and got a good phone."
2111,"Obsessed with my new iPhone. Got here fast and works great. Like brand new. Very pleased with this purchase. Did not even need to to take my phone to cricket, just popped my SIM card in and works great. Great price for the XR. I refuse to pay too dollars for iPhones considering they’ll just come out with a newer one within the year. This is the nicest newest phone I’ve ever owned. It takes amazing photos!!!!"
2112,A few scratch’s on the side but other then that awesome phone I’m never disappointed with any phone I get off Amazon .
2113,Honestly blown away!!!! Beautiful condition. Not one single scratch or dent. FULLY unlocked took it right to metro and hooked it up. Signature was required for delivery which I appreciate. I got the coral 64gb for my daughter for her birthday.It was Great deal. Phone comes w charger but no headphones which I knew already.I am so impressed I want to buy another from this seller for myself. It was chubbiestech for anyone looking. I will continue to buy from this particular seller when I have the option. I’ve saw many horror stories buying refurbished phones but I’m telling you this was looked BRAND NEW.
2114,"Considering that you can’t buy the IPhone XR at stores like Walmart or target brand new anymore. This was definitely supposed to be the next best thing If the product was actually as good as the description.My issue with the phone I received was the Quality. My screen wasn’t even sealed and you could actually peel the screen off with your finger nail. The battery was terrible. Could not get a decent charge. The speaker Quality was below average. Calls were constantly being dropped. Overall experience was terrible.Would I recommend? No. You are better off paying 550 for a brand new IPhone 11 than 301 for this. Also, the returning is a joke. Only thanks too Amazon was I able to get my full refund. The sellers were trying to keep 20-25 percent of what I paid. Simply for returning product that didn’t even come working properly. 1 out of 10 for me."
2115,"Came early, little scratches on back not a big deal, everything else is smooth"
2116,"I was a little sceptical buying this phone because some of the reviews said that the phone they received was locked or had slight damage. However, the one I received was perfect. It came fully unlocked and  undamaged. It looks as if I had baught it straight from apple. So far an overall 5 stars and no complaints."
2117,"Battery is life 84%. The scratches all around the phone, but I got a case which covered them, and visually in case it is hard to notice them. Display works excellent. Face recognition works well. For this price the product is good."
2118,Phone is exactly as I expected it to be. A few blemishes barely noticeable which is what comes with a renewed phone. The battery life is like 93% but I still get about 10 hours before needing a charge. Portrait mode doesn’t work on the front camera & Face ID doesn’t work at all. But it’s an upgrade from my 6s & I have no regrets. The quality & the price match of you ask me. I still feel like I got a steal.
2119,
2120,"All was as promised👍🏼👍🏼 I was very nervous about buying a second hand phone so I chose a ‘renewed premium’ (I think it’s called) Amazon guaranteed one. So far it’s great, A major upgrade for me from a 6s to a XR🖖🏼"
2121,"I purchased this phone for my daughter, she has only had it for 1 week, so it is a little early to review, but I have not heard any complaints from her, so all must be well. Purchase and delivery was easy and fairly fast."
2122,"Product came exactly as described, as it's a refurbished phone I expected some light hairline cracks and there are a couple. Other than that it works perfectly like new and even came with a screen protecter. Very good purchase and saved a lot of money on a high quality phone"
2123,So far I love the phone just dislike the fact that it’s at 91% battery health . It came with a case an screen protector which is amazing .
2124,Works and looks brand new!!!
2125,"This experience was a total letdown. I bought this phone hoping for a good experience and it was anything but. The first time, the phone was in overall good physical condition and almost everything worked as it should. I was let down when I tried to plug in the charger and it kept falling out. It ended up being a bad port. I reported the issue and they gracefully sent me a replacement but it ended up being worse. The replacement had a defective FaceID sensor so it was unable to detect faces AND the ear speaker volume was so low, even with the volume turned all the way up. I didn’t want to risk getting another defective device so I just opted for returning for a refund. It has been a terrible experience and I don’t recommend going for the standard renewed option. I didn’t try premium and maybe that would’ve made a difference."
2126,"Was somewhat skeptical about getting this phone from them but turned out to be a great investment. Found next to no scratches, battery life  at 100% and fantastic speeds. I would recommend getting the productRED edition since there are numerous good reviews of it and pictures showing them looking like-new. Was afraid of getting a phone with an activation lock but luckily that didn’t happen. In the end, it’s really your prerogative"
2127,i forgot that i ordered this phone. when i finally opened it the screen was very scratched up
2128,Great phone at a reasonable price.
2129,Glad to have this phone works perfectly
2130,"Depending on how picky you are about phone condition, this can be a great deal. I ordered one, but decided to send it back because of a deep visible scratch on the touch screen. It was small but very noticeable. I sent that phone back and ordered a replacement, but the replacement phone had another deep scratch similar to the first. I’m sure that most phones won’t have that issue and many people wouldn’t care about those minor defects, so I’m leaving the review at 3 stars. I was able to send both phones back for a full refund. My recommendation would be to check swappa.com for used phones, where it’s easier to get a good condition used phone."
2131,"Mine although refurbished, came with no scratches whatsoever , crisp clean and fully functional . Only thing it doesn’t come with is the wired headphones which I didn’t care for since I have my own AirPods, comes with new charging block and use charger. Very please . I was kinda skeptical at first  because I read other reviews of people having bad experiences but I didn’t . My battery health was at 98% which is good ."
2132,"I was worried waiting for this product to arrive, thinking I would get something particularly scratched up, but I was surprised to find this phone was delivered in nearly perfect condition! No noticeable damage or wear. I checked the battery health, 100%. I popped my AT&T sim card and it worked like a charm! This is day 2 with the phone, and I’m writing my review on it, literally. So far, I am very happy with my purchase.The seller I bought from was Blutek Intl."
2133,"Not only did the phone come a day early but it came in great condition; phone looks brand new, no cracks, dents, or scratches. The phone is completely unlocked and works with my service (which I was the most skeptical about) and to add a cherry on top it came with a tempered glass already installed. My device came from Kiss Electronics Inc; I completely satisfied and would be buying again (from them specifically) in the future should I need to get a new phone."
2134,"It took me a very long time to find a phone on Amazon, coming from boost mobile I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL but I swear this is not a “scam” you will get your phone and mine even worked with boost mobile! It came with a screen protector, sim removal tool, charger, and a box! And it came 3 days early! No complaints from me!!"
2135,"The phone was perfect except the Ear piece, the person on the other end sounded muffled. I wanted an exchange, instead I got a refund. Had to reorder item from somewhere else. Communication was a little off."
2136,Great renewed phone. I’ve been using for the last few months and no complaints. Came packaged securely. No visible damage or scratches at all. The only thing was the charger that they sent was garbage. I plugged it in and when I unplugged the thing fell apart. I didn’t buy it for the charger so this is still a check in the win column!
2137,Is very good the scratches on the screen aren’t noticeable to me almost at all bc I have a screen protector on. I love itt
2138,"It get really hot when charging, same problem with my old iPhone,"
2139,When I received the phone the ear speaker was muffled and distorted. I got the speaker cleaned professionally and ate the cost of that. The speaker was louder but sound quality was bad. I removed a sticker thinking it was covering a microphone. Nowhere was I informed that this would void my warranty until AFTER I tried to submit a refund request. Now I get to pay to replace the ear speaker myself.
2140,I really thought I would be disappointed like the 1 star review persons but I'm just happy I did a great job trusting this seller
2141,There is nothing to dislike
2142,So far I'm loving it battery is great
2143,"Only one issue, screen has slight issue, only when it's on a dark background."
2144,"I've had several other phones from BUYSpry, and they've been as nice as new.  This latest purchase, an iPhone XR arrived with multiple scratches on the back as well as the face.  I am aware that buying renewed products can result in this sort of thing, but still....."
2145,"It's almost a new phone, so lucky.  Its battery is 100%. Facial recognition is a bit insensitive, but nothing.  You only need to enter it a few more times to let it have more information. Now it is much more sensitive."
2146,Amazing! Would buy again.. beautiful quality and zero flaws. I’m super impressed. I bought a 7plus for my daughter from another company on Amazon and they sucked so bad. This company sent me my phone fast and the quality of the phone is literally brand new. Thank you!
2147,"Love it sooooo much, almost like a new iPhone. And the costumer service is brilliant! I crack the screen in two week and report it to costumer service. They send me a new one and let me send the cracked iPhone to him after the new one arrives."
2148,"Excellent refurbish phone!I upgraded my iPhone 7 Plus to the XR and I love it.Good screen, great battery life and is very fast.."
2149,It’s working well! Time will tell
2150,Had it for a month. It is a good phone. It froze a few times after putting my information in and had to “download” my pictures when I clicked on them kinda weird. Smooth fast keeps battery far better than my 6 or 7 did. Feel like these phones are overpriced considering but it should last me a while.
2151,The speaker does not work properly the volume is all the way up but it’s still low…I got the phone for my son even when he put the person on speaker it static it’s muffle…miss calls because the ringtone is low does not get loud at all
2152,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I love this phone got it in good condition but I dropped it but the screen protector alone broke trust me its worth it only problem got it with battery capacity at 86%
2153,I got the phone unexpectedly early than the expected date should be delivered! I have the iPhone Red 64gb and the battery is FULL 100%. No scratches and very good condition. It’s like a brand new phone! Gosh. This is amazing. You can ask me if you guys have questions. Here’s my email angelasoriano0023@gmail.comGonna update this review soon or after a month. Depends of the phone performance but it was really cool that it’s still new. Thumbs up for this!
2154,"My seller was buySPRY and I couldn’t be happier with my phone. It go to my house a day early and I took it to my carrier’s store and got it set up that same night, no complications. The phone is pretty much scratch free besides a tiny bump by the charger. The phone battery is at 100 % and it even came with a screen protector. It came with a charger and a thing to remove my sim. I would definitely buy this phone from the same seller. It’s a 10/10 worth the buy."
2155,Well I got a iPhone XR 64g and the phone shipped on time fed ex ... the phone it self was pretty new look really good ... on works nice to very happy with the buy thanks ... o I for got it came with a phone case and screen protector... nice
2156,Iphone came with 78% i had to get the battery fixed if ur not looking to get the battery fixed I recommend not buying off amazon
2157,"Truely amazed at what a good deal purchasing refurbished items are. This was my first purchase of one and was really hesitant but my phone arrived and it was literally good as new. No scratches, no dents, and no issues! It is refurbished so naturally the battery was a little used (92% health) but no complaints! Would definitely recommend picking a refurbished phone to a friend."
2158,"this is my second purchase from this supplier, the phone have no issues and we are happy with it, suggest buying from this store"
2159,Better than expected
2160,I have been using this refurbished phone for about a month (maybe a little longer) and so far so good.
2161,"I bought this on Amazon since it would be returnable and glad that I did. Phone arrived and looked good. No scratches or problems. I transferred all my data to the phone and that's when the disaster started. Battery life would drop suddenly, then it started re-booting, then it got stuck forever on the apple screen and the battery would die even while plugged in. I had to waste hours trying to figure out how to boot it up in recovery mode (which failed several times) to erase the phone with itunes. After several attempts I finally got it. What a waste of time and effort. Also wasted a new screen protector and case since I can't use them now. My advice that I will be following: buy a new phone next time."
2162,"Everything great except the screen. Mines drop from 5ft without phone case and screen protector and cracked, but other from that it’s legit"
2163,Great all around.
2164,Phone battery is worst and functioning is poor I bought this device in June and after using 3 months phone started troublingIt’s very sad to say but this device is waste of money
2165,"A veces se friza la pantalla, pero por lo demás muy bien."
2166,"The phone came in perfect condition! Had I not known it was refurbished, I'd have never guessed it.  It does come in a plain white cardboard phone box.  No instructions included and only a generic charger but honestly, it's not a big deal. Would definitely purchase again!"
2167,THIS CAME WORH 8 YEARS OF APPLE CARE AND MY PHONE SHADDERD AND NOW I ONLY HAVE TO PAY 30$ FOR THE REPAIR AND A FREE BATERRY RHEJDJEJJJD
2168,"I wanted to wait a couple of weeks before I wrote a review to make sure that it was in depth and a REAL review. This phone is great, I have no complaints. Battery life was 98%, no dents or scratches, arrived on time, still works without glitches."
2169,Battery percentage came to me at about 88% capacity. The cosmetic wear was minimal. I would recommend and buy again.
2170,"I realize that the description says 80% minimum battery life, but come on. My old XR phone (same model as one purchased) had more battery maximum capacity life and it's been in heavy daily use for 4 years. And I didn't get a SIM removal tool either. Luckily I had an extra."
2171,My son loved this. He had an iPhone 7 and the battery died very quickly. This one lasts a lot longer!
2172,phone came in great shape no issues what so ever. i was a bit worried with it being renewed but as soon as i opened the box all the worries went away. the product was easy to connect to my service and has been functioning properly for the last few months. Great deal i would definitely recommend.
2173,"The phone looks brand new, everything works perfectly fine. It came in a protective box with a charger. I was a little bit skeptical about them, but it has been a really nice product so far.I had some issues with my delivery, but customer service helped me right away. I 100% recommend it."
2174,Just wanted to write a review to thank Amazon for this phone. I have AT&T prepaid and have to buy my phones outright. This phone came with prime shipping which was wonderful and fast the only problem I had was not being told it had to be signed for not sure if that was amazons doing or fedex but still came fast and in really good shape
2175,"Delivered way quicker than the estimated time! Came completely unlocked (just not factory rest), with a screen protector already applied + a charger! It was so nice of them to include that! No scratches or anything else like that. The SIM card tray is smaller than my previous iPhone 7’s, but I was still able to keep the same sim card. Excellent buy! 10/10 recommend."
2176,The phone failed after 1 year Amazon only has a three months warranty seller was unreachable eventually said that that only work with Amazon 3 months policy. Terrible service here.
2177,"I really like this phone. I have only had it for one day, but it works and looks like new! It also came with 100% battery health. I came from an iPhone 8 and I think the XR is the best! I hope that this phone lasts me more than a few years. I think it's the best Apple iPhone. Perfect size in the hand, sleek look, big screen! You can't even tell that it is pre-owned. So far, so good! #fingerscrossed"
2178,"I came in really good condition, they also sent me a screen protector, my battery was 89%, I would recommend 👍👍👍🙂🙂🙂"
2179,                    The media could not be loaded.                
2180,Works great so far
2181,None
2182,Battery life is about normal of an iphone7 while playing games all day only charging once. The touch screen is a bit hard to get to work greatly likd other phones however that may be the screen protector and stylus i use. If the new ones I buy fix the issue ill correct the review.
2183,"When i received the phone it was in better condition then i expected. Unfortunately it would not acknowledge the SIM card. I would of NOT returned this phone, if Verizon had been able to get it to read the SIM card........ I would definitely suggest purchasing from this seller. The look, quality, and price was more then i expected."
2184,"Did not come up with a genuine apple charger (wire + adapter), came with boxgear brand charger. Battery was at 92% capacity. If not for those two things I would have given 5 stars. No scratches, worked with Metro PCS."
2185,Had the phone almost a week now and everything looks great and is working like it’s brand new. I can’t even tell this was a used phone honestly and it came with a warranty not only from amazon but a hardware warranty that lasts until September from Apple. Awesome phone and the delivery came way faster than expected. Mine also came with the original charger and headphones. 100% recommended
2186,Was hesitant to buy a renewed phone but it was well worth it. Phone looks brand new aside from some very tiny scratches here and there which isn’t a big deal for me. Battery life is perfect.Would recommend!
2187,"Really good!! I’m happy with the phone... has a small scratch on the cámara, but everything it’s so good!"
2188,"Great Buy!!! No exaggeration. This was my first phone purchased from Amazon Renewed. I ordered a yellow 128GB version. The phone was in perfect condition. You would think it was brand new. Zero scuffs, scratches, or marks. Phone battery health was excellent at 96% seeing that the phone has been out for awhile. Would definitely consider purchasing a phone from them in the future. Thanks!!!"
2189,I wasn’t sure what I would get myself into buying a phone at such a low price but so far it has been well worth the money.
2190,I was worried at first but I love it. So far it’s working great and I am in love with the face recognition. No one can see my messages or can access my phone. Easy to keep away from my nosy kids. Love it
2191,"This phone was in great condition and I'm very glad I made the purchase. No scratches. Came with an off brand charging cable and charging block, so be aware that you will most likely not get Apple brand accessories."
2192,Top quality product and service
2193,Great phone that is like new. Battery health is at 100% which is a huge plus. I like the phone and I like that I saved a few bucks going this route. The charger that came with it isn’t the stock charger but it does come with one so it’s OK. I recommend buying an extra cable though because the cable that came with mine is fixed to the wall charger so you can’t detach it and use it elsewhere w/o the wall brick.
2194,This is probably the best thing i have ever gotten from Amazon it works like new with very few visible scratches this comes with a screen protector on it and is a great price it come with a non- generic charger cord and block it doesn’t bother me but in other words GET THIS YOU WONT REGRET A THING.
2195,The phone completely died after only 4 months! The company does nothing bc it’s outside of their THREE month warranty!
2196,It arrived really quickly everything arrived neatly.  It didn't come with headphones but it wasn't that big of a deal. Battery health came at 90%. No noticable mistakes or flaws.
2197,"Very happy with this purchase. The phone came clean, charged and with a screen cover. If I didn’t know better could pass as brand new. The price was very affordable compared to Verizon charging $500+ for the same phone used. Will be buying my daughters next phone from this seller."
2198,Fine
2199,"It's a great phone with no issues. Came in a generic box with a generic charger and cord, but that doesn't matter to me. Not a scratch or ding on it anywhere and already had a high quality screen protector installed, so I know it is secondhand, but I'll consider that a bonus."
2200,"Just received mine today and it’s in excellent condition. No scratches anywhere! Battery health is at 92% which is fine with me. I bought this because I have a note 10+ and still have some time before I can upgrade but just did not like Android. Got this to tide me over until the new iPhone releases. Just like the description says it did not come with headphones. Overall, I’m happy with this purchase and would recommend it."
2201,"Upon receiving the phones, i brought them to my carrier(Verizon) and told when i put my sim card in new phone it says ""activation required""  Verizon says its only 1/2 unlocked, the phones are still locked to Boost Mobile. and with that being the case i was deceived into buying ""unlocked"" phones and certainly they are still locked to Boost Mobile. i even went to an authorized Apple dealer and told that these phones were still locked.  I have been texting Synergy many times but all they do is ask me the same question ""what does the phone say when you insert your old sim card?""  I have told Synergy three times the same answer which is ""activation required' I still have 2 phones that are locked. Synergy has said nothing else."
2202,Came good trust worthy
2203,"Came with scrapes and a ding at the bottom side. NONE of that was listed in the description, can be covered with a case. Despite that, it's a decent phone, works like new."
2204,battery health was 96% and i was expecting less but thank you-- white 128gb  no issues what so ever
2205,I ordered this for my daughter. I was skeptical about it but it works great. The only thing is that the battery life if short but she is a teen and always on her phone. The phone was gently used a couple minor scratches. I would purchase again.
2206,"I brought this phone as a replacement for my daughter after her XR was broken, the phone works great and in new like condition no scratches or dents, I added her SIM card and set it up the phone works great and no problems."
2207,First phone without the “home” button. I enjoy the larger usable screen area and learning to use the phone without the home button was quick. Product was shipped out fast after ordering and in secure packaging (good because the outer box perhaps had extreme weather and taken hits from larger packages.
2208,"The phone looks good coz of the vibrant color, but has some scratches which can be visible easily. I bought coz the price was good and I was not able to find this color elsewhere. As it was gift to my mom, I couldn’t return it else I would have returned. The other good thing is it comes with scratch guard which saves that costing too."
2209,"The phone is doing well so far, I’ve had it for a couple of months. I’m an Uber eats driver so It gets worked daily. Battery life seems a bit low but other then that it’s a good second hand phone"
2210,My renewed iPhone arrived very quickly and in amazing condition. No flaws at all on the outside. Came with off brand charge block and new charge cord. Batter Health was at a maximum capacity of 86% so that is the only sign of wear I notice. Excellent value for the money.
2211,Todo perfecto
2212,Battery life 90% This phone does not appear to be working correctly with all the apps I transferred from my iPhone 8. I am going to dump and reload some apps before I send it back.UPDATE user error once I gave it to the younger generation this phone works perfect.
2213,I have naught 2 phones one for me and one for my girlfriend. This is the one I bought for my girlfriend and I wish I would have bought it for me. I will be back to buy another one soon.
2214,I wasn’t sure if I would be satisfied with the product due to some reviews but this IPhone XR is AMAZING!! I have had No problems with the phone No wear and tear No cracks. Phone is like new! I’m so happy I took a chance because it was 100% worth it. Thank you!
2215,The shipping was really face. Phone looked most brand new.
2216,"The facial recognition did not work, the battery life was horrible the phone would shut down in the middle of 30% or 20% and the screen filled with red and green lines to where it was hard to see anything on the screen also the top right of the screen would not react to touch at all."
2217,Great phone. I have no complaints other than it is so big that using this with one hand can get annoying. The battery life on this will literally last me days. I am so impressed. Granted I don’t always use it and rarely use social media.
2218,"I absolutely love this phone. There was no scratches, I made sure examined the phone thoroughly. It charges up to 100% for the battery life. I got the yellow color and I think it was different and unique. The free trial of the ITunes is still on the phone. This was important to me because the last phone I got from a phone company it wasn’t there."
2219,Got a new phone for my mom and it works great! Just like new and for a killer price.
2220,awful the screen has at least 4 big noticeable scratches and the metal silver part has even more for 290 this is not acceptable at all save your money and get a Brand new Samsung  or something similar
2221,It was good my husband love it but only problem it didn’t come with the headphones but other than that he loves it
2222,"Recieved the phone and it worked good but the battery died quickly, when trying to charge it i realized the charging port must be messed up because it doesnt charge and i have tried 4 other chargers. They wont approve my refund request until i PURCHASE another $250 iphone xr from them to replace this messed up one before i can send it back for my refund."
2223,"It was overall a pretty good phone with no damage or malfunctions. Came in three days with prime shipping. The only thing thqt displeased me was that there are five or six micro scratches on the phone. Although they're barely noticeable, I expected one to two max. Other than that, it worked out well. If you're purchasing this expect a scratch or two, but you can't really complain for under 700 bucks."
2224,"Overall we like the phone, minor attached on the side of the phone but I don’t even believe my husband has noticed it! Great deal vs speaking1k in the store or being on a payment plan. I likely will be purchasing phones like this moving forward!"
2225,Phone arrived and looked to be in acceptable condition. Immediately put black protective case on it. A few days later I was attempting to activate it and took case off I noticed white chalky substance which I initially thought was something on the screen. I Rubbed my finger on it and felt a significant chip on it-located in upper right side where glass meets Iphone casing. If I wouldn't have put it in a black case and removed the case for activation purposes I would have never noticed it. Very deceptive sales practices. I do have pictures if return amount is disputed or changed. This customer is very unsatisfied and expect FULL refund.
2226,"So far the phone came out pretty darn good! The battery life lasts me all day and the Face ID works perfectly; the screen is sensitive, I love it!"
2227,"Surprisingly still doing well! When I received the phone in December, no scratches were seen in sight, the phone looked brand new! Came with a charger, was not from Apple but works fine. It had 97% battery health and now it is down to 90%. As a student, I use my phone extensively so the battery life lasted me all day. Very satisfied with the purchase. Buy a case too since the front and back is glass."
2228,"I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! I never buy the newest phone so when my iPhone 7 got super slow I bought the XR. I love it and it wasn’t difficult to figure out, as all iPhones are pretty much the same. Good value for the money!"
2229,If you are on the edge you should 100% buy this product! I could not tell AT ALL that it was previously used. It was like opening a brand new apple product. I absolutely love my new iPhone 😍
2230,"This phone came with no scratches anywhere or even on the sides, has great battery health, and is in great shape. The phone also came with apple charging cable and power adapter so that was great. I didn’t get any earbuds which I was okay with since I have airpods. I would definitely buy from them again!"
2231,"El teléfono llegó muy bien. La vida útil de la batería estaba en 99%, la pantalla sin un rasguño, totalmente desbloqueado, con un cargador que NO es el original pero el que llegó cumple con las expectativas, carga bien, el cable es resistente. Apenas llegó puse el chip de mi país y funcionó. En este caso 100% recomendable."
2232,They said the phone was 6.5 inches but it was only 6.1 inches. But It’s good phone I really like it😍
2233,i loved everything about the phone...however it doesnt want to stay connected to my bluetooth earbuds...that part rly disappointed me but i am TRYING to find a way to fix it
2234,"Update: After a week of use, the phone began to no longer connect to my carrier’s network. Countless hours on support with them and Apple. They are completely dumbfounded. I am never buying used again!When I saw this deal, I was extremely skeptical. Even though it is a used phone, you simply cannot ignore the price tag. It came in a generic box, with a charger and charging cable (not Apple). The one I got has absolutely ZERO scuffs, scratches or wear. There was already a screen protector on it (not sure if from previous owner or from the seller). Very, very pleased!Installation was a breeze. I just had to swap the micro SIM card from my iPhone 8 to the XR and went through Apple's quick setup. Now it's like I've had the phone for years!However, one important thing to note, is that the battery capacity for this is 92% - So it was clearly used for a bit beforehand. That is probably the only gripe. But I really can't complain because of it being used. If you are on the fence about this, I would take the gamble! You will most likely end up just as pleased as I am!Of course, only time will tell on how well worth this purchase was. Odds are if I haven't updated this within a few months of writing everything is still great!So skeptics, I would go for this purchase if you want an upgrade, but don't want to pay full price!"
2235,Phone works. cracked camera and front phone speaker not working
2236,Came perfect no scratches no cracks Face ID works and battery health at 85% I love it
2237,The batter percentage is at 94 percent but it feels like the phone dies within a hour but other than that it’s fine. Beware though you might have to pay 60 dollars for a new battery!
2238,Solid device.  No noticeable scratches or cracks.  Battery works for long periods of use and works as intended.  Highly recommend this seller.  Facial recognition works great.
2239,This product arrived a day early and in Like New condition.  Though it may state it in the documentation on line I was pleasantly surprised it came with a screen protector as well.  Transfer of data during setup went smoothly.  Could not be happier!
2240,"Phone was in very good condition , no scratches, batter life was above 90% , and cameras were not damaged and everything seem to work as if it were brand new ."
2241,"I’ve had this phone for a little over a month now and I must say that it is absolutely worth every penny. I was weary at first, because it’s usually hit or miss with refurbishes, but this one really works! My battery health is still at 100%. Camera quality is great, there are no scratches or dings, and call quality is great. I have AT&T so it was super simple to switch phone with my SIM card. I would definitely recommend this phone."
2242,"Delivery was on time and the product, so far is better than the description."
2243,This phone was sold with an OUTSTANDING bill on it so I couldn’t activate it without paying the outstanding debt. Waste of money
2244,I'm grateful for the quality of this purchase.  We have 3 other iPhone Xr devices that we bought new and we try our best to take care of them.  This iPhone Xr is on par with those phones.  I will definitely look to buy my next iPhone from this seller.
2245,"I was nervous at getting the item at first, but it was well worth it.  Item shipped fast and was in spectacular condition. Not a single scratch or mark and the phone works brand new.  Absolutely satisfied and highly advise this as a buy. Online shopping can be a risk but this one is worth taking. It comes with the phone, a 90 day Amazon warranty, a charger, and an outlet block.  Amazing buy!"
2246,"The iPhone came earlier than the expected delivery date. It looks perfect in condition, no damages, scratches, dent, or anything. I’m satisfied. I was skeptical because of some of the 1 star reviews but as a seller myself I’ve learned that petty people over exaggerate irrelevant factors to hurt a seller’s reputation. So, I’d highly recommend someone to purchase this, plus amazon is amazing with customer service and returns. It’s also a very good price."
2247,has a gap between the glass and camera and has a lot of excessive glue but other wise its fine looks new
2248,"My first refurbished phone I bought a year ago had no issues whatsoever so when it broke a week ago, went in to buy a replacement from this company. My screen freezes randomly and the touch does not always match what I’m hitting.... sometimes it’s an inch above what I select. Not very happy with it and trying to figure out how to replace it without being without a phone for a week."
2249,"I actually had to exchange the first phone I purchased, it was not compatible with my carrier. Worked directly with seller, great customer service and product!"
2250,Liked everything about it except LCD srennn going out after 1 yr. Will buy directly from Apple from now on.
2251,"I purchased this phone for my daughter and was a bit skeptical of what I would be receiving.  I was surprised, great phone, no visible or performance issues. Battery life is great, no issues with touchscreen and quality is superb. Highly recommend and I will definitely be getting more."
2252,I Cannot hear the caller because the volume of the speaker is too low even when I adjust the volume at max..2. The body of the phone set is severly scratched.3. The battery is discharged in a very short operation time.
2253,Came faster than expected! Battery life was at 90 percent and the scratches are barely noticeable. Overall excellent buy.
2254,"I can't believe how well this phone looks for it to be renewed. Omg! Fast shipping! I was having trouble logging into the cloud, but I guess I forgot my password and locked myself out, lmao, but it's cool I made a new cloud account. Thank you!!!! Activated and working flawlessly!"
2255,The phone was in GREAT!! Condition Like it was BRAND NEW. The charger wasn’t so great and no earphones. But the phone was great I was a little skeptical when ordering it but it’s a great product and I’m happy!!
2256,"I was very hesitant to buy this product, but I took the risk because it was an Amazon product. The cell phone took 1 extra day for delivery. It was BRAND NEW, or at least it looked like. The phone was perfect. Clean IMEI and unlocked BUT apparently it was a Verizon phone which is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH Tmobile network. I called the seller multiple times and did not replied to maybe change the product for one that worked for me but no luck. I submitted a request to returned it and they immediately replied and make things smooth."
2257,Good value for money
2258,"I was hesitant at first when purchasing a refurbed phone. Then I remembered my iPhone 7 was bought new, had to be replaced and Verizon replaced it with a refurbed model.Keeping that in mind, why ever buy new?This phone worked great right out of the box and has been an awesome upgrade!Keep in mind, Sprint and a couple other networks will not work on unlocked phones."
2259,"I have used this phone for over a month and I'm very satisfied with it.  It had very few marks on it, I put a clear cover on it and it's like a new phone. It works great and i'm happy. Saved lots of money."
2260,Great buy and saved a lot of money. Most definitely will buy again from this company. My phone works excelente and it looks super new no even one dent or scratch. Guys these people are the real deal and the device  works great.love it and saved hundreds of dollars.
2261,"Es más bonito en manos que en la foto.Nítido, ni un solo rasguñoMe funciona a 100%La batería tiene un 90% de utilidadLos cargadores y los auriculares no son originales."
2262,"So far, so good! Fast delivery and fully unlocked as advertised...not to mention a fair price. Easy setup to AT&T prepaid account.As others have mentioned, this phone is a bit slippery (easy to drop) unless you have a case on it."
2263,The battery is 92% and there is a damage on the screen.In general it was a good purchase.
2264,"The phone seemed fine until a week of use suddenly the screen shut off and wont come back on , worst part is I am out of the country now so can’t return it,  tried hard restart and all the tricks screen is just black phone is useless now . extremely disappointed."
2265,"It’s a good phone for it to be refurbished but it didn’t specify the condition of the phone. The phone has a bend in the middle , like it was bent and when you turn the phone on the black screen has a few color marks but it only shows on a black screen."
2266,Todo bien!
2267,Got two and love them.  Look brand new.
2268,"Very great phone! But one thing. If you want to give a like new experience, replace the battery with a new one."
2269,"absolutely perfect!it has no scratches what so ever and it came so nicely packaged.the phone came with a screen protector, a clear (protective) case, a charger, and even a sim card removal tool!This has been the best “phone shopping” experience i’ve have yet, i love it!"
2270,"Amazon refurbished has done it again! I ordered an iPhone 6S years ago from an Amazon refurbished seller. I needed an upgrade so I got the newer XR. Always a little worried about battery life when you get a refurbished phone or computer, but this one is brand new! No signs of any wear and tear, scratches or scuffs, etc. It looks brand new and I’m so happy with this purchase."
2271,Battery life is good  Phone looked new when i received it.
2272,I have only had the phone for less than a month but the quality is great the battery life is the best I have ever had the face recognition has adapted to my face even with sunglasses I am happy with my phone so far.
2273,So far it is working fine and the battery life is 90% then the new phone.
2274,Salio rasguños
2275,i really like the phone and it came early! it also arrived in good condition but i would say there's some scratches on the back camera. overall i really love this phone and it was worth it! :)
2276,It was exactly as I expected and wanted. It runs great. Sometimes I have to restart it but I don’t feel like that’s an issue because most phones need a restart every now and again anyway and it doesn’t happen often. It came fully unlocked as it said in the description so I currently have an iPhone XR with metro pcs as my carrier and I love it ❤️
2277,"So when I got this phone, it was dead and I thought all I needed to do was charge it. After hours of waiting it turned on, but seconds later the screen started bugging and glitching out while slowly turning black. I thought it was because it was still dead so I charged it for days and it still didn’t work. Honestly not worth it especially for the price. The box isn’t very good and secure and the charger isn't even an apple one, the box I got was something off brand. Honestly the only reason I rated a 2 star is because they had good communication and I was able to get the refund by the time their warranty said I should get it. Took about a whole week for the refund to come through, if you still don’t t get a refund I suggest talking to them about it."
2278,"This product was faulty, as the touch screen didn’t work more often than it did. HOWEVER....the return and refund process was extremely fast and efficient. I was impressed with both the response time of the seller and the ease of the return. Even though we were not satisfied with this particular product, I would no doubt, buy from this seller again!"
2279,Moments after get this phone set up it kept freezing up in a black screen with an arrow in the middle. To get it back to normal it would have to be restarted and would do the same thing again a few minutes later. I sent this phone back the next day and have yet to get the refund and that’s been over two weeks!
2280,"Feels and looks brand new. The battery life was already only 90%, but other than that I absolutely love this phone. Honestly my hopes were very very low when buying this phone, but I highly recommend."
2281,"The phone looked good and functioned well. But Yesterday it fell from less than 3 feet and the screen stopped working. The phone was in the protective case as well, so this is very disappointing."
2282,"I had reservations about buying a ""refurbished"" phone but the deal was so good I had to try and it's just like new not a scratch runs great and I am ecstatic to be able to get a great phone for under 500 bucks which seems impossible now a days"
2283,"It glitches sometimes, but other then that, it’s a pretty nice phone"
2284,"Although used, this iphone didn't have a scratch on it. Battery is 100%, Works perfect. I am very happy with my purchase!"
2285,They laying about the phoneBecause they said that phone is unlocked when I put my SIM card it says your phone is lockedEven I take to T-Mobile they check and say phone is locked
2286,I bought iPhone Xr .Delivery on time. Everything was good. It’s look new and working every good . Satisfied!
2287,"Perfect! Good as new ! Screen is not scratched or cracked . Phone is also not scratched looks brand new . I’m very pleased with my purchase and wild recommend to anyone ! Battery life is excellent gets me a through a whole 8 1/2 hour work day. Touch screen works great, no glitches . Again, very happy with my new phone"
2288,Brought this phone to become an iPhone user and I’m so glad I did the set up was easy the phone looked like new. I have been using it for over a month now and have had no problems great camera and video quality.
2289,Purchased this phone to replace my lost XR phone.  What I like the most is the clear pictures it takes and screen size.  Highlt recommend this phone.
2290,The only I have problem with is in some apps and on FaceTime the rear camera is very shaky. Overall I have no other complaints.
2291,"I have no complaints! The phone came fully unlocked, I have Total Wireless and all I had to do was put my SIM card in and I was ready to go! There was only a tiny little scratch on the top left corner of the phone, but that’s already covered up by a case. They even had a screen protector put on it when I unpackaged it! Totally worth it!"
2292,"Received 98% battery life. Got a SHARKK brand cable and charger, which works great. No fingerprints on the device even. Worked great, came with a ~35% charge. I feel I got a good quality renewed product and trust it even more since it's from Amazon direct."
2293,"iPhone XR came neatly packaged in “renewed” Amazon box. I cannot tell the difference between this phone and a new one. It works perfectly, battery is at full capacity, and the upgrade from my old phone was very easy from the directions in the box."
2294,Don’t listen to the bad reviews. I received my phone a day early and it arrived in great condition no scratches or cracks. And the phone is fully functional I haven’t found a thing wrong with it. It even came with a case and screen protector.
2295,"Bought this iPhone XR to replace a iPhone 6s, and I'm glad I did.  Battery life has doubled and I'm no longer plagued with random startup of apps.  Screen is larger with much improved clarity and resolution."
2296,"You won’t regret ! The battery life was at a 91, very satisfied with that. No stratches or anything and looks and functions as if it’s good as new."
2297,"Great phone, two flaws.1) The phone doesn’t always charge when plugging it in. I bought new iPhone chargers that support the XR, still the same story. The phone with buzz and say “device not supported” but won’t charge. Happens about every night that I plug it in. Super annoying.2) WIFI and this thing aren’t friends all the time. Occasionally it will disconnect. When I go to settings it won’t even show a WiFi signal near me when the person right next to me is connected.Other than those two set backs, solid phone."
2298,"The phone has been having major issues since I bought it. It frequently crashes, up to 6 or 7 times a day, for up to 10-15 minutes at a time, rendering it completely unreliable. Aside from a better battery and marginally better camera, my iPhone SE (original) was more reliable. I will be requesting a full refund for this one."
2299,It’s a good phone but I can only use it when it’s on speaker…
2300,I was skeptical at first to purchase phone due to reviews however I purchase phone and it came fully unlocked .. all I had to do was put my SIM card in and phone works just fine. No problems whatsoever. Definitely recommend.
2301,Like everything with the phone my dislike is these the camera came shaking an not taking pictures good
2302,Phone came in almost perfect condition before the estimated arrival with standard shipping. There’s on part on the screen that’s slightly discolored and the battery life is at 90% which I was hoping would’ve been a little higher. Aside from that everything else is perfect and it’s definitely worth it for the price compared to one from Apple.
2303,There's nothing wrong with the phone Is the activated battery Life is only 89%A little disappointed And the back of the phone There are some An acceptable little reverie
2304,"I received my phone from ""Digital Age USA"".  These guys do referbs right!  The phone looks nearly new. A slight scuff on the upper right aluminum bumper and that's it.  The screen and back glass are scratch free. Battery shows 94% health.  It's been running perfectly all day.  I'm very happy."
2305,Works perfect. I was worried about buying a refurbished phone but so far so good! I've only had the phone for a lil over a month though.
2306,"I liked that the product was well packaged and very suitable for play. The product has minor wear but if you’re a neat freak then most definitely it has more noticeable wear but overall great functional full, upgraded, unlocked and ready for use"
2307,                    The media could not be loaded.                 The item came perfectly fine scratch free it came with a screen protector and the transition from my old phone to this phone was perfect all I did was insert my Sim and boom I was ready to go battery life it did say in the description that it would be above 80 and mine was 95% so I’m happy with that would definitely get this phone again
2308,"I just bought one iPhone from here last week, and so far everything was fine but I just notice that the battery has 89 % of life. Well since they are renew, I guess that is something to be expected .. above all , the iPhone seem to work just normal. I was a little worry because of all the bad comments but I guess it all depend in each case.."
2309,"My phone came in looking completely brand new, there were no scratches or dents on the phone it was very clean and looked straight out of the box. However once I got my phone all set up the top speaker next to the front camera sounded very muffled like it was blown out. This lead me to return the phone but I did get my money back, everything else on the phone worked perfectly it was just the speaker that did not."
2310,This company was a great! I ordered on a Tuesday and got Wednesday the next day. I was skeptical at first because it was unlocked and renewed but when I received it in the mail it looks like a brand new phone you would never know the difference so I save money and the product was well worth it! Thanks! This is a real review for chubbitech!
2311,"I’m happy with how it came. Perfect condition, sound quality is so much better than my 8. Unfortunately the front cameras pretty weird, I’m not complaining that’s on apple. But otherwise cameras are great, everything is great, I’m very happy with this purchase!"
2312,"This is legit. I received the phone the day after ordering. There was just the phone & charger in the box. & THE PHONEEE!! It’s beautiful . It looks brand new, there’s not a scratch in site & it functions perfectly. Set up was effortless. It’s fully unlocked , I popped my SIM card in and have had no service issues. If you’re thinking about buying this phone.. DO IT! you won’t regret it."
2313,The phone has great battery life compared to my 7+. The phone itself is smaller but the screen is bigger. Makes gaming and watching shows much more enjoyable. And the seller got it to me a week ahead of the estimated time! Couldn’t ask for more.
2314,"This is the first Apple iPhone that I have owned. The Phone works great and arrived in 3 days! We live in Hawaii so it usually takes 7-14 days to get our Amazon orders, but I ordered this on Tuesday night and it was here on Friday."
2315,"Disappointed、My iPhoneX used for almost  2 years ,battery capacity Still high than which I just bought XR, Then,That I would guess this phone used for very long time ,maybe more than two years ,out side was ok, bad inside, It doesn’t come with original charge and box, not headphones. Price speaking, I found brand new one iponeXR was low price on other website compared."
2316,As described
2317,"I bought it for my dad and he seems to like it. So yeah definitely a great phone, would recommend."
2318,"buying refurbished phones will always be a gamble, i got really lucky, mine arrived in two day which was way earlier than expected the battery arrived at 89% and it barely looks used, i love it"
2319,Just need an unlocked iPhone.
2320,"Wow, what an amazing company. Shipping was speedy, got here in two days. The phone itself came in perfect condition, as if I brought it directly from Apple itself. No scratches, smudges, and they installed a free screen protector. Battery life seems awesome so far. I am so impressed— highly recommend."
2321,"I ordered this because I wanted to try an iPhone and it came 2 weeks later than the arrival date and it has scratches all on the back and some on the front, camera is pretty mid, and the left speaker does not work at all I blocked the top and bottom right and no noise from the left one"
2322,It comes in perfect condition and has an amazing battery life. I forget it’s even a renewed phone. I love it!
2323,"The phone didn't come in an apple box, but the box that it came in was very secure. It came with a charger and a SIM card tool. I have Verizon. I was able to take the sim out of my old iPhone and put it in my new iPhone, that simple no calls needed to Verizon. There was not a single scratch on this phone. It was as it it wasn't even used. The battery life lasts me about 1.5 days, but I'm a pretty heavy user. There are no issues with sound, the ports, or wifi. Such a great deal for such a great phone."
2324,This phone is great and it works perfectly. My phone stays charged for a long time and the screen quality is great and my face recognition is so good it still opens my phone up when I got a face mask on sum times
2325,Very impressed with the quality of the phone when it came in I bought it in the beautiful red color. Battery life was surprisingly good. I had a bit of struggles at first activating the phone but it ended up working perfectly fine. Very good buy.
2326,"I absolutely love this product. It work’s just as it said it would! I was worried about some of the reviews because some said it wouldn’t be compatible with verizon, but it was! I love this phone and I couldn’t be more happy! Like new."
2327,The battery does go down fast.It came in perfect.good price.
2328,"I purchased this iPhone because I wanted to see what the iPhone was all about, since just about my whole family are iphone users and I  found out it's really a very nice phone. Have been team Android for the longest and currently own the S10 but may become team iphone very soon. I love love love it and it looks brand new. Just received it today but so far so good."
2329,The phone arrived in good shape and promptly. The face recognition is great and the size is good for my diminishing reading vision. I would give it 5 stars if the battery lasted longer.
2330,THE PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN DRAGGED ON THE FLOOR AND HAS A SCRATCH FROM OUTSIDE TO THE PHONE SCREEN. AND THEY STILL SAID IT HAD NO APPARENT USE MARK
2331,"I am beyond happy ! Everything came perfect , no problems with the phone , everything works how it’s supposed to ! The seller was Electronic Deals && i most definitely recommend ! Very very fast shipping & great communication with seller! 10/10 !! 💗"
2332,Buena calidad y buen equipo....
2333,I don’t use face recognition so won’t comment on that
2334,It already came with a screen protector on it and the charger and block no headphones idk if it was supposed to come with it
2335,"I was skeptical about getting the phone at first due to the bad reviews I read, but Im glad I took a chance and trusted that everything would be great. I ordered an unlocked iphone and that was what I received. The phone is in great condition great battery health, screen has no scratches, glass isn't cracked and it operates just fine. I am pleased with this phone!"
2336,"Looks brand new. Ordered the yellow but they were sold out so the company called me with a replacement of a red. Revived it on time, works well so far. Only issue was the charger cord didn’t work but no problem I got one from the store."
2337,"Bought this supposedly ""like new"" I-phone xr for nearly $430, 128 GB. Would NOT even turn on, even after charging (btw, did not come with the charging cord even though it was supposed to). The sim card slot would not open no matter how hard we tried. There was a large crack in the camera lens, and the silence switch was crooked. Will be returning immediately."
2338,i love it
2339,"I was really skeptical about buying this but I was pleasantly surprised after I received it. My phone came in an almost perfect condition. No scratches, screen was intact, the camera worked well, and it is covered under apple warranty until November 2020. I love it so much. I purchased it from Chubbiestech and the delivery was quite fast. I’ll update this review after a couple of weeks of using the phone."
2340,Very satisfied and happy with my purchase. The cell was in great condition.
2341,"This item is really perfect condition. I’m very glad to have this product. Other than that, It was a great kindness to added a gift protective cover with the screen protector that they put in the packaging while the product was sold."
2342,"I love 💕 I would recommend it to anyone!The phone was in excellent condition, It came with a nice clear case +screen protector. I’m so happy I was able to save some money and be a part of saving our environment and the same time."
2343,The phone has no scratches at all. Came with 90% battery health. The phone is fully unlocked just as described. Cant ask more from a renewed iPhone. I'm 100% satisfied by my purchased.-The seller was: Chubbiestech
2344,"Got phone today a day earlier than promised. Phone seems to work pretty good, there are minimal signs of wear on the off and volume buttons, but other than that it looks brand new. Battery life was 93 which is pretty okay."
2345,"After reading all the reviews I decided to purchase this phone and I have NO regrets. It arrived faster than stated. It is in perfect condition! No scratches and works as if I paid $800 from Apple! It was unlocked and had no problems activating service. Very happy with this purchase! Also backed by Amazons 90 day purchase protection, so peace of mind is a huge plus too!"
2346,"First thing I noticed was a white spot under the screen that never went away, the swipe up function for the home screen does not work, the phone will not hold a battery charge. Also, took over 3 hours to reset and update because the phone was never reset. This phone was needed urgently! Now o have to return a phone that was not checked for refurbished condition at all! I have to print a label, repackage this, and send (all while having no phone) only to turn around and buy another. Waste of my time. This seller has poor business behavior!"
2347,It was actually ligit and a real iPhone. The only thing I had was a little scratch on my Face ID camera still works great tho. Also around the front camera it was chipped a little the color was
2348,Bought the red one for my daughter. The phone looked brand new. No scraps or scratches. Went to Metro and switched her old phone number to this one with no problems at all.
2349,"I always switch back and forth with the iPhone and Android and this time I came from an lg k40, the iPhone is great. The camera has great quality. This phone is unlocked and it works with MetroPCS. The phone also came with a SIM card for a free 1 week trial of a prepaid phone service but I never used that. I ordered the phone and it came within 2 days."
2350,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I LOVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MY PHONE!!!!! It is got here and I set it up. It’s n EXCELLENT CONDITION IM SO PRESS! Finally upgraded from a 6 also it arrived very quickly I just ordered it a couple days ago so definitely 5 stars from me so far. I was skeptical but I’m soooooo happy thank youuuuu :)
2351,"Phone arrived in near perfect condition, extremely minimal signs of previous use and works exactly as it should. Overall Battery life was at 96% which I checked against my 6 month old Iphone 11 and that was at 94%. Can't recommend this seller and product enough over paying retail."
2352,the charger is of brand the max battery capacity in the settings is only 90% and the camera rim is scratched but phone looks good and comes with a screen protector
2353,"Purchase of iPhone XR “renewed” went well, as the phone itself works like new, with only exception being the installed battery barely at 85% maximum capacity."
2354,"I received a like new iPhone XR that set itself up when I paired it with my old iPhone 8. The phone is in perfect condition and came with a charger. I just put my SIM card in and it worked perfectly. No earbuds were included, but other than that, set up was simple and the facial recognition is an amazing evolution of the iPhone. Great product!"
2355,Really love the new IPhone XR. It’s a big change from my old IPhone 6S but I had No issues setting it up. I have Straight Talk for my carrier and it works great I was a bit worried buying a reconditioned phone not knowing what you’re going to get. However it’s works great. The no home button was kind of a learning curve but there’s plenty of YouTube videos out there to tell you how to use her new iPhone XR.
2356,"I like the phone works good, only issue i have with it is takes screenshots on its own without me touching anything quite annoying. I have to continuously deleting screenshots. They don't tell you the truth when describing the phone. That's the bad part when buying renewed. I'm giving 3 star on this.Overall a good phone just be carefull."
2357,"Everything worked perfectly, I have been using it for a few months now. I have had zero issues, and it works like a brand new phone. I could not even tell it was refurbished. No cracks, or chips on the phone. All features work as they should. Battery life is excellent."
2358,We were definitely skeptical to spend this much money on tech funds on Amazon. But I’m glad we did. You wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between mine or a brand new one from the store.
2359,
2360,It shipped fast and the deliver was quick. it’s seems like everything is good so far. They also included a case which was nice. I only had a small scruff on the side of the phone but I wouldn’t have noticed it if I didn’t look for it.
2361,The shipment didn’t arrive on time nor the next day!! This survey came before we even had the item!!The price of this phone should have had everything!It did not come with earbuds for music!The charger was not Apple it wasA non name brand and dirty!!
2362,came earlier that expected delivery date.no scratches anywhere on phone. phone came properly packaged.battery life was at 100%. touch decrees excellent phone worked fast. it came with ios 13 that wasn’t a problem though. didn’t come in original box as said in description. over all amazing buy worth the money.
2363,"it has no scratches on front or the back, battery capacity at 98%!! phone last me all day and charges quickly when u arent using it. speakers r loud and i had no problem getting service with my carrier. love this phone!!"
2364,"We are very familiar with I-phones and set up.  This one was a nightmare we could not overcome.  I spent an hour on it and then my husband tried for over an hour.  Locked up and just ""spinned"" half way through set up.  Consulted google and youtube - no help.  Hardly able to get back to reset before returning phone.  Not sure I was able to remove everything as just locked up and unable to get to ""Settings"" to confirm everything out.  Can I say nightmare one more time !  On top of that, the packing tells me that unless I go to settings and confirm that google and apple passwords are out, that my refund may be delayed and I may pay a restocking fee.  Total waste of time and not sure of security.  Will now have to change all my Apple passwords etc to be sure that I did not return phone with information on it.  Will never try this again."
2365,This phone worked perfectly! It came with a substantial screen protector already on the phone. Only one tiny blemish (paint scratch) that I seen on the camera lens but it is 100% cosmetic. Highly suggest!
2366,"The phone came very clean with a screen protector on, everything work just as good as brand new!! No scratches no nothing."
2367,"Did seem like the battery drained quickly, but I am chalking that up to the installation process...."
2368,"This seller is amazing was a bit skeptical at first but this phone met my every expectation, very trustworthy in every way no it doesn’t come with headphones. At least it comes with a charger & a 90 day warranty I also got a brand new spanking battery I’ve checked the serial number online it is worthy!!"
2369,"Upgraded from a 6 to the XR. My phone is so perfect. Honestly if the packaging had been different, I would’ve thought this was a brand new phone. No scratches or anything whatsoever. Full battery health at 100%. The seller was BuySPRY. This phone is fully unlocked. I have Straight Talk, and it was just a matter of adding my SIM card to the phone. You will not regret this purchase!!!"
2370,Upgraded my old phone and couldn’t be happier with my purchase!  Phone looks and acts like new and got to me quickly
2371,"Was not sure about ordering a renewed product, but I was shocked. IPhone XR looked just like a new one and working just fine.  Battery holds up the whole day for me. I am not a gamer!"
2372,Good
2373,I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and the seller! 5 Stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I got more than what I expected! The phone works like new and I received my purchase fast! The seller also provided a clear case and screen protecter! Thank You!! Awesome! 👍🏻
2374,This iPhone is great and performs perfectly.  Battery was 100%.  Performed same as when it was new.  What else is there to say.  Happy that I purchased it.  I like the used phones sold by the Amazon.com.
2375,Everything works on this phone as it should. I got my daughter this same phone in yellow brand new. I got my son this red one for half the price and it looks and works just like the new one. Delivery was fast ( 2 days)
2376,"Just wanted to write a quick review since I was a bit skeptical about buying a phone from amazon. It arrived a day early it was in excellent condition, fully unlocked works on our U.S. Cellular plan. Few scratches on the corner of the screen but that’s to be expected with a used product. My gf loved it as an upgrade from her old iPhone 6. Will probably buy myself one as well. Thanks."
2377,"Got a little freaked out by some horror stories in these reviews so I figured I’d throw in my two cents. This phone is great! No scratches, battery at 99% capacity, everything runs smooth, came fully unlocked etc etc. Don’t get scared off by the bad reviews, the few people who get a bad phone are just more likely to leave a review, and if yours is broken you can j get a replacement one."
2378,"Camera wasn’t really good, worked but just ok."
2379,I was nervous to order this phone but the the took a leap of faith and got it my phone came earlier then expected and it was in perfect condition everything works perfectly fine I’m really happy with it would recommend
2380,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I bought this iPhone XR (128GB, Coral - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) Sold by: Kiss Electronics Inc) for $499.53. The body was in good condition, but the touchscreen responded weirdly. I thought that I just needed to get used to it because I was moving up from an iPhone SE. But, after two or three days, the phone started typing by itself (see video). It was like a poltergeist with terrible spelling had taken over the phone! Needless to say, I returned it. I’m back using my trusty SE and debating whether to try another Amazon refurb or go directly to Apple.I gave this three stars because the price was reasonable, the shipping was prompt, and the phone was good condition. It lost two stars because of the self-typing."
2381,Okay guys I was nervous about buying this phone but WOW so highly impressed! It looks brand new I would never have known it wasn’t. The smallest scratches on the screen but nothing I would or will complain about. It came with a charger and that’s all I need! Working with a Verizon prepaid phone. I had z e r o issues getting it activated. I love it!!! My boyfriend will be ordering his next ;)
2382,"It works perfectly, I was scared when my husband ordered me this phone, but honestly no need to worry. Everything works volume isn’t damaged the phone has no scratch marks, or chips, not visible damage. The phone works and sounds great. No lag. It works perfectly."
2383,"I got the phone yesterday. Until now everything is going well, the battery came with a 87% life that is pretty reasonable. The only thing that I didn’t like is that the camera has a few scratches on the borders but it doesn’t affects the photos quality."
2384,I wasn't too sure about buying a used phone but I'm glad I did now. I was pretty much like new and the battery was great as well.
2385,                    The media could not be loaded.                 It’s in perfect condition. Looks basically brand new nothing noticeable at all. Only thing I disliked is the battery like is 89% but that’s how my old iPhone was that I just had so it’s fine I guess.
2386,"I have had my phone for about 1 month, and in this 1 month I have had no problems, phone came in perfect condition not a single scratch on anything, battery health was at 97% was expecting way lower. If you are looking for a new phone I highly recommend getting from here"
2387,I love this phone! It’s a beautiful red color and everything works! I recommend taking a class or two to learn how to use all the things this phone can do.
2388,I was a little hesitant since it was renewed and with all the stories people said the phones were stolen or not fully unlocked. I went ahead and bought 1 and had no issues so I purchased another one with no issues!
2389,"Both iPhones look pristine. Quality wise I’m very satisfied with this purchase. Battery life is not perfect but it is about 90%. Very good.On the other side, iPhones arrived 1 week later than expected which of course did not like at all."
2390,"I bought this phone in December 2020, about 2 months ago. For the most part it works well but the touch screen is a little glitchy. The camera doesn’t work properly, it freezes after taking 1 picture. I have to press the side button to lock the screen, and then the camera works. Lately, I can’t slide down to see the notification bar or to see the control center."
2391,Awesome device
2392,"I was hesitant to buy this product last August after reading a few reviews from people. I am happy to report that over 8 months later, the product is still working perfectly and has had no issues for me (knock on wood). I would recommend this iPhone for the quality, the price, and the fact that it is still a newer model phone. definitely worth your money!"
2393,"I LOVE THIS PHONE OMGGGG!!!!I was team android and figured I’d switch to iPhone and I’m so glad I did. I’m currently typing on the phone I ordered (in the bath lol, hope I don’t drop it!) I’m 110% satisfied. No glitches, no techno problems. It did come with a scuff On the edge from the previous owner I assume, but I have it in a case, and that didn’t bother me at all for the deal I got."
2394,"I got the iPhone XR black and it works really good, the battery last all day and longer and the screen is smooth with transitioning app to app and gives no problem. Came with no scratches and and a screen protector already as well..doesn’t come with headphones so don’t get mad about that lol."
2395,"Works fine.  Battery at 94%. Came with a screen protector.  Put it immediately into an Otter Box so I don't have to worry about scratches, dents, etc. but it seemed to be free of those.  So far I'm happy I saved a lot of $$$ over the Apple factory refurbished.  Ask me again in 90 days :)."
2396,Had to find my grandkids mother a new iphone and she wanted the XR Black everybody else wanted $500-$700 clicked on Amazon and the phone was half the price and a free phone case and the color she wanted and unlocked she was very HAPPY 😃!
2397,"Phone works perfectly fine, Screen is beautiful has good battery life definitely a good purchase."
2398,So far the phone has been great. There was a glitch that happen once with the screen clicking stuff by itself. I only had this phone for maybe 2 weeks.
2399,"I love it so much! I really came to write a review because I had a problem with other people's reviews. If your phone comes in cracked or damaged- 99% of the time it's because of transportation, not the seller. You also have 90 days to return/replacement and it's easy and fast with amazon. If the phone's software has an issue- that is where you blame the seller. That is why I never buy/don't buy something based off reviews EVER."
2400,"My first I phone is a complete disappointment. T he seller  stated the phone was tested and in perfect working condition. It was not.  After all the set up  it took, creating an apple account and everything switched over from old phone to new phone . Made my first phone call.to discover You can’t hear the caller and caller can’t hear you.  After spending  2 hours on the phone with  apple support going though everything we could think of. Via  Apple technician,  I was told to send the phone back. I was not going to do that because then I would be without a phone. The seller would have to receive the phone before I was given  a refund. I chose to keep the phone and bought I pods. ( love the iPods) but it is such a hassle, when getting a call. I have to run get the I pods before  answering the call, or use the phone speaker so everyone around can hear your conversation. Are use extreme caution in purchasing anything from this seller. I Thought I could just get use to using the iPods .. I can’t, so I’m going to take a great financial loss , and selling the phone for .$50.00"
2401,"Product came early, and was in new condition. Works flawlessly with 100% battery available out of the box. All features working. No scratches, no software, hardware defects. Would definitely buy from this seller again. It’s important to note that it literally says in the description of the device that the oem charger and headphones are not included. You do however get a great charger In the box. 10/10 so far!"
2402,"I was thrilled when I received this and quickly got it setup and started using it. It took me a few days to figure out that the microphone did not work. On calls, or recording a voice memo, the only thing getting through was white noise. I hope the vendor improves the quality assurance testing on their renewed devices. This phone was great otherwise, very good cosmetically, but I needed it to function as a basic phone too. Response to email regarding the issue took almost 4 business days which was disappointing but they did send a prepaid return label and are promising a full refund (we'll see how that goes)."
2403,I bought two of these one red and one yellow my yellow phone came perfect look completely brand new and worked perfect but my red one however has a cellular service error it cut off and a middle of an update.
2404,"I was very skeptical in buying this, but I needed an upgrade desperately, so I decided to take the risk. I’m very glad that I did. It came in perfect condition, full battery (and the battery life is magnificent), no scuffs or scratches. the box was unmarked and white with a knock off charger but that wasn’t a concern for me. Fast shipping and delivery. Worth the money, definitely."
2405,It comes with a screen protector and it works amazing and is a really good phone
2406,"Brought it one month ago and still no issues, looked like new."
2407,This phone is a good phone it didn't come crack it's not messing up or anything you know because of some of the reviews I was little iffy about it but this was one of the best purchases I've ever made
2408,"Product looks brand new and in perfect condition. It has no scratches, facial recognition is good, and screen quality is great. This is my second time ordering a phone from here and I am not disappointed."
2409,Im not gonna lie to everyone at first I was a little Hesitant about the buyer from some reviews but I gave it a chance... two weeks in and so far the phone is perfectly fine so I highly recommend giving it a chance.
2410,"When we got this phone the speaker didn’t work. Can only be used on speaker phone which wasn’t a big deal at first. After 2 months, the screen stopped working. Took it in to get fixed and the repair place said the refurbish was so badly done, they can’t fix it."
2411,The camera don’t work properly😕 it’s looks real shaky and it makes a weird sound every time I go to the camera.
2412,this product is so awesome. nothing wrong with phone. a bunch of storage and red is a rlly good color. the battery life is also really good. way better than my older iphone 6s
2413,"Phone works fantastic for me, for someone who is on a budget and can’t spent tons of money for a brand new phone from the apple store it’s so worth it l. My old one died and I needed it right away. Super fast delivery"
2414,This product is awesome. Has a few minor scratches but nothing super noticeable.
2415,"I have had for a while now and all is good, I would recommend to everyone who's looking for a good used phone. HB"
2416,recived phone and its not able to ADD it to my network  doe to phone not being unlocked
2417,I love this phone! I will never buy a phone from a phone company again. Thank you Amazon
2418,I purchased my phone from Kanga Supply and I love it. My phone was perfect no scratches no nothing! I liked how they added this SIM card remover. I really don’t like the charger it’s very slow and off brand. I recommend that you get a better charger because the one they sent sucks. But the phone is great. Totally worth buying from Apple.
2419,"Really good all around, only a few problems the speaker on the phone isn’t very loud and won’t allow me to set up the hey Siri ? But other than that the phone works like perfect."
2420,"This is a awesome deal, wish I would have known about unlocked phones sold on Amazon. Would have saved me a couple thousand dollars . But I know now. And you would never know that I didn't pay 800 for this phone."
2421,"Wow, def worth the value! This XR is working AMAZING and def is a under radar buy, love the phone.General scratches around camera but works like new"
2422,"Es un equipo muy bien cuidado, funciona bien y su pantalla estaba intacta. La condición de su batería llegó en 89%."
2423,"The iPhone XR basically came in perfect condition. There is the faintest scratch on the top right corner, and occasionally I find an issue when tapping in that area but other than that totally fine! It came in a simple white box in bubble wrap with a charger that was not an original Apple charger but it works very well! I would recommend this purchase to anyone."
2424,"This phone was in pretty good condition, save for a few barely noticeable scuffs on the chassis and the 92% max battery. The phone was fully unlocked as advertised. I'm impressed!Bought from Chubbiestech"
2425,Perfect in every way.  The phone is in excellent condition and the battery life is super.  The picture is shown with a clear case on the phone that I put on after receiving the item.  Would purchase from seller again.  Thank you.
2426,I love that my phone arrived earlier than anticipated. It arrived very quickly! It had one or two nicks but being that it’s a refurbished phone I guess it’s fine. I love my phone and glad I ordered it. I was so torn about inheriting a used phone and not knowing if I was making the right decision but so far so good.
2427,"It took a few minutes ,but I finally found a minor blemish…... I'm sure I'll add a few more in the coming years… The phone was worth the extra few days for delivery.. No disappointments here.  Phone is well worth the money …."
2428,I was so nervous to buy a reused phone but everything the say they do is true my phone came with no scratches no dents no cracks nothing it looks as if I bought it from apple it self it works great I set it up with metro and it took less then 10 mins it was so fast an easy I highly recommend this phone and company
2429,So I have bought this phone because the other one is defective. However so I purchased the XR. Its not really good. The center piece on the iphone was low whenever I would be on the phone. It kept on breaking up and i was just fed up. I will never buy iphones from this website again. This was the 2nd time i have had a defective device.
2430,"Bought this for my 15 year old son and it came spotless, as if new. It came in plain brown box, had it been in an apple box it would be very difficult to tell it wasn’t brand new.  We are very pleased and will buy from here again."
2431,"Wow! I am literally speechless...my iPhone XR just arrived (a day early) and in less than 15 minutes I was ready to go.  The phone is spotless, not a scratch on it. Thank you Chubbiestech I could not be happier with my purchase. I highly recommend this seller and their product, I am amazed!!! Please note that I received a SIM removal tool with my phone, I had ordered one just in case but it came with the phone."
2432,Wish it came with headphones. But phone was in great condition upon receivable.
2433,Esta a medida
2434,"Everything on the phone worked. The only thing is there’s a fingerprint on my back camera that I cannot get off and it clouds the camera slightly. But other than that, all features work. The phone was compatible with my network as well."
2435,Better only has 86% capacity and the speaker is blown.
2436,"The product is overall great. Wasn’t fully aware that it would come with bigger scratches and scuffs! Either way the phone is awesome and works great. Didn’t come with an adapter though, which is quite a pain considering no headphone jack."
2437,Keyboard was randomly buffering and letters weren’t typing
2438,"It did take a little while to come in.  But completely worth it. No obvious damage to the phone except one tiny area around the camera. This is not a scam. It also came with a phone charger, case, and screen protector."
2439,The phone is good! No big things to fix
2440,                    The media could not be loaded.                
2441,"i definitely love the color of this phone ! i love the camera quality, and the price of it! it works like a brand new phone. the battery is getting used to being used again , but it reaches 100% ! absolutely love it, and would recommend buying from this seller. will definitely be buying from them again !"
2442,Looks brand new
2443,"We were worried like everyone else when looking at refurbished electronics but this iPhone XR 128 GB phone showed up in pristine condition (no scratches no dents no flaws of any kind), it looked like brand new. We are very happy with the product but even more happy that we ordered. My wife loves having a newer iPhone and says it has more than met all of her expectations. Thanks so much for a pleasant buying experience ExclusivesDirect!"
2444,"At first glance was hesitant about buying this product from Amazon, but it was the best purchase i ever made. Came with no scratches or damage. Battery life health is at 98% almost brand new. If there any problem message  Android devices when you activate your phone you just go to your provider so they can fix the problem."
2445,"It worked great. I thought I had a spider crack in the face. They offered me a replacement, but I decided to wait.  Turns out that it was a screen protector and the phone is perfect."
2446,Phone came in like new condition the charger was a generic kind and only lasted my daughter 2 weeks before it gave out... the box was not original but a very cheap cardboard box all in all phone was good and she’s had no problems. Besides baveing to buy a new charger.
2447,I purchased 3 iPhone XR through the same seller. All of them are excellent. I am very happy with all of them. I will definitely use this same seller for any future purchases.
2448,"What's not to like? No flaws to screen or case. Only the very tiniest mark on circular camera surround, you almost need a magnifying glass to see. I waited a few weeks to leave review, since I wanted to go thru it thoroughly before giving review. Everything seems to be as new!!!Highly recommend seller  HQTRONIC LLC"
2449,"got the phone in amazing time, great condition, great battery life and just looks and works well. i was skeptical but i had to try to get some savings and also be more environmentally responsible. this seller will get my money again because they sell quality product."
2450,"Nice phone! Everyone works as if it was new. I ordered a fair condition and got an excellent! Im very happy. The transition was easy from my iphone6 to the iphone10 but i did need to go to att and get a sim card installed, the old one didnt quite fit. I would order again!"
2451,Picked three of these up so far for the family. Since February 2021 have not had one issue !!!
2452,Absolutely love this phone dont listen to the bad reviews!!!! This looks brand new no scratches no nothing! and i was completely hesitant because i was reading bad reviews but its amazing!!! I dont hate anything about this phone!!! Love love love!!
2453,I’ve had the phone for 2 days (I’ll update my review later if there are any issues) and first impression was it already had a screen protector on it. (Tempered glass one at that!) and it looks as if it is in brand new condition. Amazing! Then I did the transferring from my 6 plus to this and it was seamless. Perfect! Now I just get to enjoy it and I have no regrets. It’s exactly as if I would have purchased a brand new phone. You would never be able to tell! 5 stars for sure!!!
2454,I was scared to buy after seeing some comments but great phone actually works perfectly fine and is actually unlocked of course its a used phone so u might see a scratch or two on the metal but other than that every thing is in perfect condition
2455,Was very difficult to transfer from one phone to the other.
2456,Looks great. Feels like a second hand manufacturer though being honest. Not in an apple box or with an apple case/charge it’s a store bought charger. I thought everything was good till I discovered a crack. Thought it was the screen protector so I take it off to change it and there’s a crack right along the E in update if you look. So kind disappointed
2457,Phones In Exellent Co sit-up . It practically Nee. Everything works great. I actually ordered another phone which will be here tomorrow. We have Verizon and it was very easy took a SIM card out and put in new phone and it works like a charm. Great by will do business again.
2458,"Beautiful phone, but doesn't work 99% of the time, the apps, text, internet anything when you click on it it doesn't load up and just defaults back to the main screen. I am currently trying to set it to factory settings so I can send it back but it won't even boot up. I'm going to try getting another after this one is sent back. I'll re adjust this review then.*EDIT*the seller will not refund the money we spent on this broken phone. today is 6/17/22DO NOT BUY**EDIT AGAIN**Finally it's July 26 and we've been refunded, with a restocking fee. Absolutely ridiculous since they send us a phone that didn't work.  BUYER BEWARE"
2459,"My phone arrived Jan 30,2020. I got the coral iPhone XR . I’ve had it for few days and so far the phone is in good condition. I haven’t had any issues. I saw some scratches on the screen but it wasn’t bad that I needed to return or exchange . It is normal . The battery is good and lasts good. 100%. The phone came as if it was practically new. No issues . It’s legit."
2460,Do not believe the bad comments you will not be disappointed I was a bit skeptical at first but once I got the phone I was most definitely blown away literally looks like a brand new phone
2461,Excellent condition  iPhone XR. Looks and functions like new. It arrived earlier than the promised delivery date. I’m very happy with my purchase. I would buy from this seller again.
2462,I have been an android user for over 20 years. My family have been trying to convince me for years to get an Iphone and I'm happy I did. The phone was delivered sooner than the date promised and the setup was quick and easy. I would recommend anyone looking to buy a new phone to shop here first. Im thinking about getting my mom one for Mother's Day.
2463,Arrived on time and was of perfect quality! Absolutely no blemishes or flaws and was unlocked.I was able to easy transfer all data from my old iPhone to the XR in less than an hour. Battery analytics show 97%.Would recommend and purchase through seller again!
2464,The phone had at least 90 percent battery which was ok for me. No scratches or any problems. I made sure to wait two weeks before reviewing just in case. I am very happy that the quality of the phone is high despite being refurbished.
2465,The phone arrived in perfect condition and was professionally packaged.  It was so easy to transfer my Sim card from my old phone.  I was up and running within an hour! The screen size is comparable to my old  IPhone 6 Plus. I am really happy with my purchase!
2466,"iPhone XR was in good condition, as described. Shipping was prompt and I received the phone early. I’ve been using this iPhone for a week and it performs as it should. I just popped my sim in and setup in a few minutes I was ready to go!"
2467,"Love it! Works perfect, like brand new and I had no problem setting up service! I was worried because I saw a few bad reviews but I think that was just the competitors. I received mine from Verizon Pre-Owned."
2468,Tuve un celular Android por 12 años y nunca quería pasar al sistema de Apple ya me decidí y le compré un teléfono iPhone y no tengo ningún tipo de queja llegó tal cual como lo describían es nuevo pantalla sin raya el precio es la mitad de lo que cuesta en un centro de venta de teléfono regular estoy más que satisfecho en haberle comprado un teléfono iPhone a ustedes
2469,"When I received phone it had noticeable scratches on the bottom. What I didn’t like is I had to pay a $6.00 shipping cost to return, they don’t pay to ship item back."
2470,"Don’t buy this phone!!!! I bought a beautiful blue color, it worked PERFECTLY for two months then it got blocked by T-mobile. I contacted T-mobile and guess what? They tel me this phone was previously owned by a guy who didn’t pay off the full price. Now I’m stuck with a BLOCKED IMEI PHONE and Nono one can do anything about it!!! Tried to return it and the seller won’t accept my return. Currently working on starting an A-Z return request via amazon. Such a disgrace."
2471,"I'll admit I was a little hesitant at first because when I first purchased a phone from a different seller, it didn't come in good condition. I was stuck With the phone for about three months until I decided to upgrade to the XR. All I can say is that the phone arrived in great condition and it came early in the mail. I would definitely recommend this!"
2472,"I had downgraded from a 7plus to an SE because I switched carriers. So when I upgraded to the XR, I was delighted to finally have a phone with a screen I could see without squinting. The camera on it is wonderful in comparison to the SE, I enjoy being able to use it for pictures, watch movies, or to just text. Oh and the new Memoji features are super cool and fun. I’m living the XR."
2473,"It came in excellent condition and worked with my carrier.  No problems updating, but some trouble with setting it up because it required a new icloud but the company was great with assisting us. But overall if I had to I would definitely purchase again."
2474,"This phone is so good. Everything is amazing! I’m typing on in right now and it’s so good 😍. If you’re unsure of buying.. don’t be.. just buy it! I don’t remember the sellers name, but you just have to take a risk with one of them."
2475,I love my new phone and the plus to my phone is that i paid less then i would of in store and it’s also come with a screen protector which i was going to buy myself but i don’t have too and it come fast also will which is another plus it’s been 3 days now and i love it!
2476,"Bought this phone as a gift for my niece.The iPhone arrived in perfect condition, earlier than I expected, not a scratch or blemish on it at all. Great packaging, speedy shipping, and an incredibly incident free experience.10/10 would order again."
2477,Super happy with my purchase. Was a bit worried cause had just gotten done with ordering and returning two iPhones from Walmart.com that did not work. Got this iPhone XR without even a scratch on it a screen protector already installed everything works on it and even had 90% battery left. Super happy. Will order again.
2478,"Phone came in acceptable conditions. Scratches on the side. All aspects of the phone work except for FaceTime and IMessage. I went into an Apple store and was directed to call a technician, called 3 over the phone who told me the same thing to restart my phone and would not call back after I restarted my phone. The last one I make sure I skip that trouble shoot solver and move on, he said there was a problem (probably) with my carrier. Went over to my carrier and had someone tinker with setting on my phone to no avail but in her defense she is not Apple technician. She confirmed that my plan is what it is and that there shouldn’t be any problems. I then call amazon who then after describing my problem calls iPhone and put me back through that process over the phone where I did not get a call back again. I messaged amazon and this guy Mark seems To be the most helpful and recommended I try to replace the phone. Might return all together and get rid of this headache"
2479,Was sceptical at first but the phone arrived after 2 weeks because of the COVID but the quality is tops... the camera .. battery life. Really happy with the supplier and the phone. Satisfied customer.
2480,Works great. The speaker while on the phone sounds a little garbled but it’s tolerable.
2481,"The battery capacity was at 100%. There aren’t any scratches, cracks, or anything on the phone. It looks brand new and the blue is vibrant. It runs perfectly find. An Amazon worker even called to remind me about the 90 day warranty in case something happens with the phone."
2482,The phone is as promised. Nice piece
2483,N/A
2484,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Entire left side is unresponsive to touch, the screen goes crazy when I'm not even using the phone as if I'm hitting all kinds of apps, sending random one letter texts and all without touching the phone itself."
2485,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Only issue I had was around the back frame of the camera is a little damaged. The camera itself it okay, but again it’s a renewed iPhone so I can’t complain too much :) I was a little worried it was a scam but it indeed is not. The phone works exactly as my current iPhone X does and exceeds my expectations. I can’t wait to give this to my best friend for Christmas."
2486,"El iPhone ha llegado en perfecta condiciones, parece que lo hubieran sacado de su caja original y lo hubieran puesto en el que Amazon envía. no tengo ninguna queja. 10/10"
2487,It came in perfect shape and works amazing I’m so happy
2488,"I got the black iPhone XR 128 gb at&t version from The Cellular Resource and it has at least 6 visible at arm's length scratches / marks on the phone. There is an obvious scratch in the center of the screen.I understand that it is a renewed item, but from all the renewed/refurbished products I have gotten from Amazon, they have looked and functioned brand new. This is also the first item on Amazon I have purchased that I created a new Amazon credit card for and planned on making monthly payments. As I see in the reviews that many people got phones with no cosmetic damage to it, I feel slightly ripped off to be making monthly payments to a phone that has many scratches on it."
2489,"I was skeptical about buying this phone but glad I did! The phone was like new and I’ve had it a month and no problems. It also came a day early, I would purchase from here again!"
2490,My phone was not able to read the SIM but the people were quick to respond and refunded my money somewhat quick.
2491,Screen was scratched and eventually became a weak point but it came with AppleCare+
2492,only thing i was disappointed  in was rhe was the iphone was shipped.I received  it in a shipping bag and rhe phone was slidding around in the box.
2493,When I ordered my new phone I was pretty skeptical.... hoping my phone wouldn’t be damaged or a fake.. It shipped and I had it within days! It came with a knock off charger but I’m not going to be using it anyway. I checked for the battery health and it’s at 100%. Phone came with a screen protector on. Nice packaging. Couldn’t be more perfect! Would recommend.
2494,Calidad del artículo.
2495,"The phone is in amazing shape, extremely happy with my purchase!"
2496,Only worked for 3 months
2497,Phone was exactly as described in excellent condition and vibrant coral color
2498,I’m submitting this on the purchased IPhone XR.  Getting used to more “sliding” of apps.  Wish phone would “pair” more easily with car radio via Bluetooth...older iPhones paired with car radio seamlessly.😐
2499,"Honestly very happy with the money I paid, well worth it. The phone is almost flawless with little to no signs of use. The color is outstanding, it was easy too setup & transfer everything over from my 6s. Definitely recommend. It’s a beautiful phone & functions perfectly."
2500,"I got this new iPhone when my old one went for a swim in the pond in my backyard. I have not wanted to spend the crazy amount of money on a new phone that they were asking, so I went with a renewed phone. I was not disappointed. The phone looks brand new and acts brand new. I am so glad I made this choice."
2501,"Came in perfect condition which i was really nervous about. Battery is perfect, it lasts forever and I don’t have to charge it as much as my previous phone. I haven’t had any problems with the phone; i’ll update my review if I do but I’ve had it for 2 months and it’s had no problems. It really is like a brand new phone."
2502,I needed an upgrade in my iPhone but refuse to pay $1000 for a phone.  Purchasing this XR was the best decision.  I was encouraged by the many positive reviews and have not been disappointed.  It is so great to have options when it comes to purchasing phones.  I was also super impressed because it arrived 2 days earlier than promised!
2503,The phone has no problems I recommend buying
2504,"Worked for one week and then it turned off spontaneously, without ever powered back ON again , hope to get my money back"
2505,"I bought this phone for my 13 years old son, works perfect, my son is happy with his first iPhone, he is on vacations and lockdown so was the Best Buy I did for him.The only comment is that didn’t come with the original charger nor headphones but that was not a problem. The phone looks like new."
2506,The phone is exactly what I have been looking for
2507,"I liked how the face recognition picked up quick. The battery life is good, i use my phone all day and by the time I go to bed it still isn’t under 20%"
2508,Worked like brand new no issues. My daughter loves it.
2509,Phone came in reasonably good shape not scratches on the screen howeve there are some slight chipping by the charging port. Overall it is a good device.
2510,the phone was a lot better then i thought it would be
2511,Worked good for me.
2512,"First time buying a “refurbished” phone. Was kinda apprehensive about it. Got it for my granddaughter and she loves it. Says everything works perfect no problems. Now, I’m thinking about buying MY next phone refurbished and saving some $."
2513,"Took a reasonable amount of days to arrive. Came with charger, end piece and something to open your SIM card thing with. Seems brand new , no scratches Or scuffs"
2514,everything but the iphone speaker for phone calls doesnt work and my back screen is cracked
2515,Small scratch on the screen but over all it’s really good
2516,I absolutely love this phone. Amazing pictures and super easy to use. My husband and I are switching from android to apple with this phone and I don’t think I’ll ever go back. I was a little nervous to order due to seeing negative reviews but I watched a recent unboxing of this exact phone and I changed my mind and I’m so glad I did!!
2517,The phone was great for the first 30 days until I tried the water resistant features. The phone should be able to go underwater for thirty minutes. I only had the phone underwater for about 30 seconds before taking it out. The phone worked fine until the next morning when lines started to appear on screen. It glitches out and I had to remove the SIM card and return it. I’m buying for the apple website now and never from this company again. I do not think the water is what caused the damage because the phone worked fine for many hours before glitching
2518,Everything is perfect like it’s a brand new phone and I haven’t experienced any problems of any kind since I’ve been using the device
2519,Honestly was very surprised by how it came out. Shipment was okay and phone was in perfect shape. Didn’t find a scratch what’s so ever so it was basically new besides the battery life which at 94. Overall great purchase. Looking for an iPhone on a budget that works and looks like new then would recommend. Hope this helps.
2520,"I was kind of nervous to spend $500 on a refurbished phone. I was wrong! I got the iPhone XR In black, and it came in nearly perfect condition.  It came with a charger as well. The battery life has made a huge advancement, even from just the iPhone X! The camera quality is AWESOME, and overall I rate it a 5/5. Worth every penny."
2521,I use it for work doing deliveries and it will stay charged for a while but I have to charge between lunch and dinner
2522,Very happy with the phone.
2523,It was a early birthday gift for my 12yr old daughter she loves it.Phone works great easy to use and very clean like brand new.
2524,Phone came in just as ordered. No scratches no dents phone looked new. Phone works as well and there has been no problems with it. I would order from here again.
2525,"Besides the back camera having a little bit of glue showing on the edge, the phone was in good conditions and everything. The phone came with its own clear case and screen protector. Very good. I bought this is February 2021."
2526,thanks.very nice
2527,"Excellent and I’m happy I went with this vendor. The first one audio was not working but I was able to exchange it for another very quickly. The seller was very responsive to my request. The other one, came within 2 days and that during covid-19 pandemic. The second worked perfectly had no damage and 100% battery efficiency. 5 stars."
2528,"It was not 100% battery life but that is understandable either way everything else is fine, I definitely recommend."
2529,"Great product. It’s not in perfect condition as stated but it’s near perfect. Camera area has a few scratches paint that isn’t worth fussing about and a very teeny tiny scratch on the screen by the front camera. Battery is at 99% so no issues there either. Buttons feel new as well. Seems to be running fine. No hitches or glitches so far. Overall, this is worthy of 5 stars."
2530,"There were sone cosmetic blemishes that were visible, however, overall satisfied by the speed of delivery and quality"
2531,"It came on time. And in perfect condition... Highly recommended for me!!!I know your concern. Battery Life?.  is it gonna work in the first place?My Answer is Yes, worked fully, Battery life is good. I charge it takes 19hrs life span and that’s when I overuse it. So get it highly recommended"
2532,Daughter absolutely loved it.. She hasnt put it down in months.. Could not be happier with the purchase.. Looked as new could not tell any different then new.. Came in plain box but i just said that was part of the surprise so she didnt know what it was.. She cried she was so happy.. Thank you guys..
2533,Everything on the phone worked other than the fact it was still carrier locked to T-mobile
2534,The phone looks brand new. No problems at all with it and it arrived a day early.
2535,Iphone was a gift for my sister. Shes had it for about a month or so now and its as if i bought an iphone brand new! Everything works fine as my own iphone. Great purchase
2536,Phone runs great as expected the only problem is that the battery health was at 90%. I expected at least 95%. Other that that everything is awesome!
2537,Good phone came with 96% battery .a little dirty in the speaker on the top of the phone and a small scratch on the screen
2538,I love this phone and it works like a charm
2539,Never used an iPhone however it was so easy to set up. No problems. There is no way to tell it is not new. Case and screen is perfect
2540,I looked at reviews which made me comfortable to get the item and I was completely satisfied... got a charger and phone was as brand new as can be so did my friends own come as well I’d recommend them
2541,Great refurbished phone. Was reluctant because of mixed comments about not working with Verizon but gave it a shot anyway. Worked fine for me. Would have given 5 stars but missing accessories (which was advertised but I want it all lol ).
2542,"You would never know that this phone is not brand new. It works great. There was not a scratch on it, and the battery life is great. I am glad I took a chance on this because it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone. Well worth the money!"
2543,I ordered this phone on December 31st and got it on the 5th of January which was 2 days sooner than expected and it is flawless! It looks brand new and works as if it is brand new! I am 1000% satisfied with my purchase!!
2544,"Came basically brand new, was slight scuff, but virtually it was new! Was a gift for my brother. He was pleased. Came with keynoiece to remove back/reset. Brand new charger cord, and box"
2545,I received the phone and condition is great! It has 2 small scratches on the screen but the rest of the phone is great. The camera is wonderful but the screen is delayed and sometimes it won’t type clearly.
2546,"I was a little skeptical at first about it, however im glad I bought it. its super light weight, reasonable battery life, literally the real deal. I had an android phone but im soooo glad I made the switch. dont believe any of the negative reviews because this product is awesome. also it is fully unlocked so it is compatible with any SIM card."
2547,"I bought this phone for my 8 year old. He loves it! He initially had an Android but wanted an iPhone like his sister. The quality was amazing, no visible scratches. We had no issues with added the phone to our family plan. He wanted the red one, because that’s his favorite color. The color was vibrant red! No issues at all! And the price was reasonable."
2548,Love the phone aside from the ear mic which sounds fuzzy.
2549,"This is great! It came with two chargers and a plug-in, and the phone has a screen protecter on it. All the negative reviews say that there is no SIM card which is true, but their cheap anyways so don’t believe the negative reviews this is a great product."
2550,I had mine doubt about buying a iPhone XR brought this in same price for SE second generation work perfectly fine
2551,So I received this item as promised. When I charged it and set it up everything seemed fine until I went to use the camera feature.  There was a strange crackling sounds only when using the camera. I immediately packed it up and started the return. I took it straight to the UPS center and mailed it. It took three weeks to get a refund. This didn’t make sense to me. After two weeks I emailed them and they said they just received it but my tracking showed they received it with in three days of me mailing it.Yes the refunded my money. No they didn’t do it in a timely fashion. Every other time I have returned something with Amazon they have refunded it almost immediately. I would not purchase anything from Woot in the future
2552,The phones seem to be working good so far. Hopefully they don't go to crap after the warranty is off.
2553,The phone is perfect literally like if i bought it from the apple store. Only thing is battery life doesn’t come 100% comes around 95-98% which is okay consider the condition and functionality of the phone. I would recommend this product to anyone.
2554,"Product was unlocked as promised, able to connect to Boost Mobile's service. One of the speakers doesn't work, but for the price I'd say it can be kind of expected to have some mishaps."
2555,"Ordered the iPhone XR, 64GB in Coral. When I first ordered it, I had my doubts about buying a renewed phone, but when the product arrived my thoughts completely changed. Everything works great and the battery health is at a perfect 100%. Great purchase and recommend anyone ordering one who’s in the market."
2556,Phone looks really new ...fast shipping...am surely ..fully unlocked..am surely buying more to post to my family in africa... awesome seller .. I pray no fault comes out from the phone ... but overall phone is spectacular... I recommend this seller guys ...
2557,So far this is a very good product!
2558,The overall process was great. I received the phone earlier than estimated & was very nice. I gave it a lower rating for price simply because it's just hard to believe the price of iPhones ( from the old school generation). I would use this supplier again!
2559,"I wasn't to sure about taken a chance on this phone after reading the comments. I'm so glad that I did, my phone got here pretty fast and as soon as I got it, I inspected it and everything looks good on it. Surprisingly it looks like a new phone.I will update this when I put my SIM card in it and use it for a few days."
2560,"For starters, this phone was big, too big for me to hold comfortably.  Oh well, I figured I'd make do.  Love the display, not having a home button was actually pretty nice.  However, after about two weeks, the face recognition didn't always work (set it up again, but it didn't seem to help), and I couldn't get the Bluetooth to work with my headphones or anything else, ever, even though I could with my iPhone 6.  Back it goes, purchasing a new product that is smaller in size, with all parts working."
2561,It wasn't unlocked to be used with Verizon...
2562,"I bought this phone for my son as gift last Christmas. The phone had problems holding a charge and went dead last week and would not charge at all. Took it to the repair shop. The screws were warped, screws missing inside and after trying to replace the battery, charging port and other items. The phone was deemed unrepairable. Now I have to buy a new phone again. I will never buy another phone from this vendor. Totally a waste of money."
2563,"Like new- everything works perfectly and appearance is like new! It came with a nice case at no charge and a screen protector - unfortunately the screen protector was broken, but it was free and unexpected, so I can’t complain."
2564,Wow. Came as advertised.  Unlocked and ready to go at delivery.  A few minutes to set up from an old Iphone 6. Then a SIM swap.  BAM.  Up and running.  Saved $150 or so buy this quality refurb versus buy new.  Only blemish was a little wear near the camera lens Which you can barely see.  Well worth the investment.
2565,"Awesome, came exactly as planned. I don’t understand how this phone is renewed! It looks brand new, no scuffs or marks. Checked everything from: camera, microphone, speakers, flash, battery life, etc. everything was brand new. Don’t get scared of the other reviews that look bad. I too was scared but I am extremely satisfied. If I ever need to buy a phone off Amazon Renewed again in the future, I won’t be worried."
2566,"This phone is definitely worth it for the money. It came in practically pristine, save for a few very minor cosmetic scratches on the back. It seems just like new to me though and I’m very satisfied with my purchase!! Thanks Kanga Supply :)"
2567,I’ve only had this phone for a day and it’s great! Just like new! It did come with a charger and cube but the cube didn’t work but that doesn’t bother me at all. Very pleased with the phone so far and will probably buy another for my son!
2568,Just purchased in Feb.of this year. In middle of using phone only have an apple logo on screen. No warranty. Says the apple warranty expired. Up to now the phone has volume control since I received phone. Now this would not recommend this model.
2569,I bought two of these phones. One has a battery life of 100%. The other just 86%.
2570,I was a little skeptical about getting the phone because of all the bad reviews but I’m glad I did . ITS PERFECT . 100% battery life and comes with a charger . Thank you to the seller !
2571,"This refurbished phone worked like a charm, right out of the box. At a bit less than $400, it was a good deal and a great upgrade from my old phone."
2572,"Worked great for a few months.  3 months to be exact.  I purchased this on March 28.  On June 30, the phone powered down and stopped accepting a charge.  This was two days outside the return window.A trip to the Apple store confirmed that it was a hardware failure and could not be repaired.After reaching out and explaining to the company they are simply unwilling to make a return or repair for 48hrs outside their 3mo return window.  They have offered no other solution or accommodation.Very frustrating."
2573,Battery life 89%. Screen slightly scratched. Very well for de price.
2574,Very pleased. Like new
2575,"This phone came in so quick. It came in 2 days. The packaging was very legit but it wasn’t original apple packaging either. Instead, it was an amazon box. The phone came with everything except headphones. Not sure if the charger is an original apple product but it looks like so. Everything is new. The phone has no scratches or dents. None of that and it looks like it is new no joke. The phone is fabulous. I recommend."
2576,I was a little skeptical ordering a phone like this online. However the seller guaranteed a return if the phone did not work out. My phone was like new. I swapped my SD cards and went about my business. Everything turned out perfectly.
2577,Few scratches but I use a case anyway ... it’s not boost compatible even though it’s fully unlocked. I took it to cricket which I received a new phone as well and the internet service is tremendously better.
2578,Skeptical to buy anything refurbished or used but pulled the trigger. Very happy with this iphone. Good price and the shipping was quick.
2579,"Don’t let the bad reviews fool you- came in great condition! I absolutely love this phone. When it came in there was no scratches- looked brand new. The 128g storage Is a dream, I’m not even used 1/2 of it yet (I upgraded from an SE)."
2580,Everything apart from the speaker works. After playing a couple audios and messing around with the setting I wasn't able to get the audio to stop being muffled. This led me to think that there was something wrong with the speaker and not a setting on the phone.
2581,"Got the phone as should of looks like its in great condition however when set up there was all kinds of errors and now will not even turn on, it flashed and said there was an error and shut off and will not turn back on."
2582,"Phone looked new. They did a good job refurbishing. I couldn’t tell it was a used phone. When I’m ready for my next phone, I’m definitely going to order from this place. It’s a lot cheaper than financing a phone."
2583,The phone came with all the necessary accessories and they also added in a phone case and screen protector. Also the battery has a capacity of 96% which is really good. No scratches or problems with the use of the phone. A great buy overall.
2584,"My phone came in with a few minor scratches on side but it still looks brand new, battery life was at 88% which is more than my old iPhone 6. The screen is bigger but overall the phone is great."
2585,"Phone came fast, had no problems with it, great purchase"
2586,"Loved everything about this iphone XR but had to return it disappointed.  The audio level of the ear speaker was much too low. Tried all manner of adjustments and tips.  I don't think the ear speaker was defective, this seems to be a design issue.  Too bad, but my old iphone 6 is much clearer and louder at the ear."
2587,Great phone for the price.  Bought this for an upgrade to my teenage daughter's phone and she has been very happy.  Battery life is long and it was in pristine shape.
2588,The camera came with a crack on it in the inner and outer rims.
2589,The iphone XR at the present is living up to the quality as advertised.
2590,"I was a little nervous buying a phone site unseen but I'm glad I did. Looks brand new, has wonderful battery life, and works great. It was a bit of a hassle getting it setup, but not because of the phone, the service provider was stupid  (Boost Mobile). 100% happy with my purchase and I would recommend."
2591,I purchased this phone two weeks ago and I have to say it is a really nice phone. It took a bit of time to get used to no Home button but it’s fast and the battery last longer than I expected. A lot longer. As this was a refurbished phone I expected some wear but there was none. Looks like brand new.  Great camera as well.
2592,The phone wasn't unlocked as advertised.
2593,"Honestly I find, that the iPhone XR that I received works fine and good to my standardsIf I can summit up in one word satisfied yeah satisfied"
2594,"Came looking brand new, no dings or scratches. The screen works perfectly, the battery “health” was about 90% when I got it, it doesn’t die very quickly but it seems to take a long time to charge!"
2595,Looks like it's brand new
2596,It’s essentially a brand new phone without the new price tag.  There are 0 scratches  on both sides of the phone that are visible to the naked eye.  5⭐️ Rating
2597,The phone is perfect no defects. Phone is operable was able to activate on my current service with ease. Battery life is as it should be. I would do business with the company again and recommend!
2598,A solid upgrade for a reasonable price. Bigger screen and functionality in contrast to iPhone Se equates a satisfied purchase. Condition of iPhone XR is 100% functional and clear of any cracks or mishandling. Thank you for both a reliable phone and quick shipping.
2599,"Beautiful phone ! It came with no scratches,cracks , or phone looks brand new and battery capacity at 100% and it came with a case and screen protector as well as charger. I love it ! Happy Customer here! Ordered from chubbie"
2600,"Phones perfect , havingSIM card problems , saying my SIM cards locked, that’s my only issue other then thatPhones perfect. 5-6 stars"
2601,The spreaders nor microphone works properly. The battery life is horrible dies easily and takes forever to charge and the phone keeps on overheating. Face recognition is on point that’s the only good thing about it.
2602,This is my first iPhone.  I bought it for its privacy and security features.  It's taken me a bit of time to learn the quirks of its UI.  But it works fine.
2603,"Arrived on time and on date it was supposed to. 3 days.  No issues at all.  Inserted SIM card and phone loaded all it was supposed to, and works fine."
2604,Running like new my daughter is enjoying so no complains
2605,I have to put phone on speaker for the other person to hear me but that’s it!
2606,Phone is what i expected it to be. A couple of dings and chips on the edges but the screen doesn't have a scratch on it and the back of the phone looks okay too. Overall 4/5
2607,My phone doesn’t work all the time with camera I have missed out on so many memories because it would not take picture or video also the videos I watch online doesn’t work all the time just sometimes. !! Other than that I like the phone
2608,"I figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by Amazon for a refurbished iPhone XR it would be worth it to save $99 by ordering a refurbished for $500 rather than order a brand new one from Apple for $599.When I first opened the box, updated the phone and got it set up with my apps, everything was great. Then I went to the Apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories. When I was putting on the screen protector I noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen. It appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen. I’ve taken photos to share.I ordered this phone as I’m traveling and needed a new phone. Well I have no choice but to eat this scam by Amazon and the seller because I’m traveling and don’t have an option to not use this phone.Amazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale. Not images copied from Apples marketing of a product."
2609,"I've only had the phone a couple days, so its hard to rate the quality.  So far so good."
2610,"I’m enjoying my new phone it’s doesn’t look like renewed everything is perfect , Doesn’t come with real box and original charger but I’m using my old original charge without having any problem, thank you for the seller"
2611,El teléfono por momentos empieza a “quedar loco” como si se apretara el touch en alguna parte.No se si es falla del teléfono o que. Igual lo uso sin problemas cuando para. El teléfono en si en excelentes condiciones. Como nuevo.
2612,"If you’ve become accustomed to the Red Dot, well too bad, with this amazing IPHONE 10xr, you don’t get one. But, you do get a beautiful iPhone with so many bells and whistles this quarantine will be a breeze.  I love my brand new phone.  KC. I am sure the camera is great, I still have to play with it."
2613,I got two phones from this seller one red and the other one black. Almost perfect condition the black one had a little scratch that is almost not visible...
2614,Good deal for the price. Didn't come packaged to well but phone works fine so no complaints.
2615,"I'm Brazilian, I was afraid the telephone does not work here in Brazil, but it worked perfect!Telephone came as new (no scratches , perfect screen - with screen protector, 90% of battery life, in a perfect condition)I love it ! Thank you"
2616,It was a gift for my daughter for her 12th birthday her 1st phone ever I could not be happier and neither could she great deal home is perfect thank you!
2617,Had a little issue with the phone when we got it but customer service was great. They were quick to respond and quick to replace it. Would definitely recommend this seller.
2618,This phone came in 2 days and came with a case and screen protector. My phone came unlocked with no cracks or dents. I verified it’s a real iPhone w apple. I love my new phone everything works great and no problems so far.
2619,"The phone came in better conditions than I expected. The screen and back are good. Camera quality is amazing. The package came in a normal box inside was a box charger and a charging cable, also the phone came wrapped in bubble wrap. Setting it up was really easy. Thanks!"
2620,"My son recognized that this phone has served him well. WANTED the exact same phone when his became inoperable.  Loves it, just like new and wasn't 1100 dollars. Get one if you don't need to compete with the Jones."
2621,"I like everything about the XR phone.I like the color.I like the touch screen,it is better than my other phone that I had.It’s got a lot of memory too.Lots of picture room on it as well."
2622,Wow!! This was an amazing deal on this phone it came a day early...could not be more amazed with this company and quick service...buying a phone online makes most worry ...not with this company..no worries at all!!
2623,Great phone fast and reliable. I don't use all the features on it but all that i use have no issues. This is my first phone and i am happy with this pick up. Thank you
2624,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Phone came days early and in great condition with 93% battery life! It came with everything that would be included In a original iPhone box except with a different package box itself.  Have been using it for two weeks now with no complaint. A great buy!
2625,"First of all. This phone came delivered two days earlier than I expected!! It is absolutely beautiful and looks brand new! It’s definitely better than my old iPhone 7– The camera is wonderful. Switching over to my cell carrier was so easy. I love the face recognition and the size of the phone. It was packaged perfectly, included headphones and even directions or a return policy. Thanks so much!"
2626,I was very impressed by the quality of this Refreshed iPhone XR. The phone looks brand new and the battery health is still at 95%. There is only one minor scratch on the screen which is only noticeable if you look very closely.
2627,"Reading negative comments I was scared. But I decided to buy it and it arrived like new, so far it has worked without problems. The battery complies with the 92%."
2628,"Compre este teléfono para mi hijastra y la verdad que fue una muy buena compra ,el teléfono parecía completamente nuevo"
2629,Great phone no issues at all.
2630,"Received an empty box with a charger and cable, no phone.... what a joke"
2631,"When I purchased it, was suppose to be unlocked but it wasn’t... resolved shortly after 3 days......I use it for work and personal use"
2632,"I am beginning to think was this phone really unlocked>? 1.5 hours on phone with apple, 2 hours in apple store, 2 hours at tmobile.. Everyone  said this phones ID is locked, Even running diagnostic software at tmobile with this new SIM installed Frustrated.....I am returning it"
2633,"Writing the review on this phone now. Normally I don’t like to purchase refurbished items as it can be pretty risky, but so far I’ve gotten the iPhone from this seller and a laptop from another seller both in untouched condition. I’d trust refurbished items on here at least since there’s also a return policy."
2634,"I Didn't know what to expect. But I was very impressed with the over all condition.in my opinion, this is a Brand new phone.."
2635,Great phone no problems hooking up to Verizon. No scratches on screen great for refurbished. Just received it a few days ago so time will tell. So far very pleased
2636,I bought this phone because the 7 plus that I had the screen broke and be of corona virus no apple stores are open for my screen to have gotten fixed. The iPhone XR is very swift I got it in white which gives it a very clean smooth look. However I am having issues putting my boost mobile sim Card in the XR it is saying I need a punk code i called Boost mobile and they then told me the phone is locked. Now I dont know what to do
2637,"Not only do I love this phone you’d swear it just came off the shelf you wouldn’t Know it wasn’t bran new,usually I go to EBay I’m so glad I chose Amazon."
2638,"DO NOT ORDER from the seller KANGA SUPPLY!! I never write reviews but this one really made me mad. This is the second phone from them that I have received with some sort of issue. The first phone had WiFi issues and was finicky in less than a month!! Not to mention the screen cracked horrifically with a case and glass cover on the front from a small short drop. Can you say CHEAP screen?? In all my years of having an iPhone and dropping them by accident with a case and glass cover, I have never broke the screen EVER. The second phone came with a giant scratch down the right side of the screen that’s completely noticeable. I understand these are pre-owned but there should be no deep scratch like this on the screen itself. They use cheap parts and don’t want to refund your money. Plus, they are way overpriced considering phone stores are selling their iPhone XR’s for cheaper."
2639,The phone came to me today but it have a few scratches and the battery maximum capacity is 86 and that's so bad but the phone work good and the charger is not for real iphone and the box is not for iphone xr it's just a white box and it came without headphone I hope this let you know more about this iphone.
2640,Delivery sucks I give 4/5 star but good phone
2641,The phone looks and works great they also sent me a free phone case and screen protector. Took long to get here but i guess it was due to weather problems.  I would buy from them again
2642,"Tiene señales de uso, pero se ve bien"
2643,It came in great condition. There was a little scratch not too bad it came with a screen protector and a case which I didn’t expect but was nice. Definitely get you wan if you’re planning on upgrading yeah
2644,"Good product, fast shipping."
2645,"Battery life arrived with 94%, no dents or major scratches, great condition looked brand new. No headphones or original charger."
2646,Good phone
2647,It doesn’t respond to my touch on top and bottom right corner
2648,Is in perfect condition and the wife was happy with the color came with a charger too! I would recommend this seller for any refurbished phones (3rd one from them)
2649,Phone arrived in extremely good shape.  Battery showed to be 96% of full capacity.  Also ordered one for my spouse.  My experience with these phones has been very good!!
2650,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 The screen quality is amazing, the battery life is 90% even though i wanted it to be more than 95% but its ok. There is a few minor scratches too. My main problem is my speaker, its horrible and vibrates hard. It seems damaged and that is a big problem for me, so i am disappointed."
2651,"This is my first iPhone I've had. I was a little nervous buying a renewed one, but there were very good reviews from the buyer I used. The phone was in perfect condition - I saw now scratches on it at all. Mine came with the original charger as far as I could tell. The camera takes awesome pictures. I am very happy with my purchase."

2688,Bought this phone for my daughter. She is happy with the quality of the product. I am happy with the purchase and would definitely consider using this same company for any future phone purchases.
2689,I was very surprised that this phone came on time and works properly! It’s refurbished so there are some small scratches on the corners but not noticeable! I just needed a new phone for camera quality and the camera and audio is amazing! Very impressed and am going to buy another one for my  man!
2690,This iPhone XR is wonderful. I love it so much. I love to text my daughters. I haven’t had an iPhone for years. My last one was an iPhone 4. I love the size of it too.
2691,This iPhone is surprisingly good. I just knew I wasted my money. But didn’t it’s really good.
2692,"I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loves it! She had the iPhone 6 which was on it's last legs so she was pretty happy about the upgrade. She was amazed at all the features it has as opposed to her old one. She's happy, so I'm happy. Great product and although it's refurbished, it looks brand new. Not the slightest scratch or imperfection. I would highly recommend this seller."
2693,"Shipping was extremely fast, especially with all the delays of COVID-19. Phone arrived pretty much brand new, with only light scratches caused from previous owners keys and such. Can only see them if the screen is off and you're LOOKING for them. Battery capacity was at 100% Bought this as an upgrade for my friend who had the iPhone 6. She absolutely loves it!"
2694,A few knicks on the phone but my main concern is the bottom of the screen is lifted. Called left HM and order number. Being Xmas no idea if I’ll be able to get in touch with anyone. The bottom literally is lifted and makes noise when pressed 😡Screen has visible damage item not stuck on reset/erase. Beware 🤬
2695,"Just received my I phone XR. Even though it was refurbished, it looks brand new. Not a scratch on it. So far, I absolutely love it."

2698,Got the phone and it doesnt even turn on. Big waste of money and time
2699,This phone is good so far I really like it. It’s just like new.
2700,"Just, lifechanging in general."
2701,This process was nothing short of spectacular. I immediately found what I was looking for and actually received my device earlier than expected. When I opened the box I was surprised to find what looks like a brand new phone. As someone who is in the cell phone business I can say that you’ve checked all the boxes on this one. Thanks!
2702,I am surprised to see this is a used phone. I could find no imperfections and battery capacity shows it is at 100%. I didn't receive apple OEM charger or cable but the cable they included was 10ft and the charger is fine. What a good deal.
2703,"I get that buying refurbished iPhones can be a roll of the dice, but I have yet to be blindsided.  This is probably the 5th refurbished iPhone I’ve purchased off Amazon and have yet to be disappointed."
2704,"Perfectly reasonable condition for am refurbished. Wish I would have skipped the Android experience all together and bought iPhone years earlier. Might have gotten one cheaper on auction, but no worries about it not being fully unlocked / iCloud locked here."
2705,Ok so I was skeptic but turns out this phone is really good for the price that it is. No scratches or glitches sound quality is good came with charger wish it had headphones have to order them separately but either way I’m loving it big upgrade from the 6
2706,"Just got my renewed XR, I would've assumed it was brand new if it weren't for the small scuffs on the edge of the phone, scuffs so small I wouldn't notice them unless I were trying to look for them. Very happy with this purchase, hope it gets me through the next few years!"
2707,Nothing to say other than 100% customer satisfaction here! Refurbished phone...BRAND NEW CONDITION!!! 100% battery health and the color is so stunning that the pics don’t do it justice! If you’re hesitant to buy because of it being a refurb  please don’t worry about it. It’s was totally worth the money! P.S. it literally arrived four days before the estimated arrival date which was amazing!!👌😁
2708,Screen isn't broken . Great shipping. Bug display and it being referbished honestly can tell the difference
2709,phone speaker does not work. Can only hear on speaker on mode
2710,"The phone over heated and I had to pay an additional 140 to fix, this vendor is trash"
2711,"I am very satisfied with this product, I was unsure to buy this iPhone because I was afraid it’ll no working, but this iPhone XR was in a great condition, everything works perfectly the camera, battery, microphone, etc, it comes in a box with all seller’s information."
2712,Coming from a S8 here. It is a worthy upgrade. Love the phone outright recommend buying it however when I received it the microphone didn’t work and had to pay a little extra to fix it also the battery is horrible but maybe that’s normal for iPhone 3.5 for me
2713,"The phone was in perfect condition, no scratches and the body of the phone looked great and it was mailed fully charged. But when the battery went low the phone did not charge not with the charger that it came with nor any of our chargers. I was happy that I was able to return the phone and receive full refund, no problem."
2714,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Works perfectly! I was skeptical at first to make this purchase but the phone came on time, with a charger, an 30 value SIM card and no damages. Very happy with this purchase."
2715,I’ve had my iPhone 8 Plus for three years & I’ve never bought any phone from amazon before. I was a bit worried at first.But I’m so happy I did. This XR works flawlessly. It’s fast & everything works on it! It also arrived a day early!  10/10 recommend
2716,I wished I had of shopped longer for this purchase ! Live and learn ! Came in quickly BUT was only packed in small thin plastic bags NO BOX of any kind as specified in the article. The screen has WAY TOO MANY SCRATCHES FOR THE PRICE !!! And to give it as a gift that makes it just not possible !!!!
2717,Had this phone for over a year now and no problems *knock on wood* - a lot cheaper and a great deal. I'm a fan
2718,This is my second iPhone XR and I have had iPhones over the years and love them all.
2719,"Everything works great! Battery life is so much longer, I don’t charge until night time now. The image and screen quality are great. Love my new iPhone"
2720,For the price I paid I’m highly satisfied. The phone came earlier than expected it also came with a case (value $35.00) screen protector and a charger box. Feels like new. I would definitely buy from this company again!
2721,"When I first setup the phone, the camera didn’t work.  After I installed the latest software update, it started working."
2722,"Fast delivery (3 days USPS), phone was in great condition, screen protector already installed was a plus too.I will definitely be using you again."
2723,"I’m very impressed! This phone came with a few very minor scuffs on the front but hardly noticeable and was expected. Nothing to make a fuss about. It is overall it is in excellent condition. The battery life is good, processing speed is fast and the photo quality is great! Very quick shipping and came with a (generic) charger, and a screen protector. I’m extremely pleased with my purchase."
2724,Liked how new it looked screen quality was perfect battery life last all day all night
2725,"Looks new , no marks anywhere. Battery 86 % . Excellent communication with seller."
2726,The phone works great but there are some visible scratches on the side of the phone.  It’s not in like new condition like described but so far works great.
2727,I love the phone and its my favorite color.
2728,You seriously can’t go bad. I ordered a yellow xr and the speakers were blown. But JUST ORDER ANOTHER!!!  with the 90 day quality guarantee I’ll choose this company all day!  But sadly only 89% battery Capacity.
2729,"It was great, a little skeptical at first but overall was a great birthday gift for my sister. It’s very good on battery life don’t have to charge as often but yes I recommend getting it."
2730,Decent Phone
2731,Bought mines from Hybrid IT. Best seller ever. High quality service and phones. So far i bought 3 phones from them and no problems. All in 10/10 condition.
2732,Well it's my first iPhone and it's awesome because I'm already a Mac user. The best thing was the store I bought it from. They put a glass screen protector and included an extra long braided cable and fast charger. Awesome referb. In perfect conditon.
2733,I received my phone today. Got it all set up and everything transferred from my old iPhone to the new iPhone. No trouble out of it. Works great! No scratches or dents. Looks like new. I love it!
2734,Was skeptical to get it but came on time and works. So glad I took the chance and bout from this store. The phone had not damages on the phone.
2735,Face recognition is fine the phone is self looks fine but the volume goes in and out I cannot cut the volume up the ringer is very low even with the phone turned up high also if I’m on FaceTime on a regular phone call the volume goes in and out
2736,"I was kinda frightened to buy this phone because the reviews, but I bought it and it is great! It looks like I just got it from the apple store."
2737,Good but slow delivery
2738,"Purchased a renewed iPhone XR 256GB. The screen seems to be fine, which is a plus. However, the device did have some dirt on the frame, there is a small amount of adhesive showing from where they removed the screen, and the entire device has a slight bend to it.Needless to say, the device will be going back.Also, while it is within the range advertised, the battery health was at 86%. If you are opening the thing anyway, replace the battery, please."
2739,Received in near perfect condition. Unfortunately it was apple locked.  Tried several different Apple IDs that I have and nothing worked.  Very frustrated!!
2740,"I use this product for work/casual purposes. I love that it is unlocked and I am able to use on any carrier. In my suggestion, the phone should have been placed in better packaging such to protect screen and prevent scratches to surface but overall everything else is exactly as described and the phone is in perfect condition. Would I buy again? Absolutely!"
2741,"I ordered the phone on Friday and received it today (Sunday) it said I wouldnt get it till the 11th, super fast shipping and so far I'm impressed with the phone. It's only the first day of having it but I like it. Hopefully it will be a longer lasting phone."
2742,"Wasn't really sure about buying it but well, I could return it anyways if something dissatisfied me. So far, it's been good,  phone battery lasts enough, screen works perfectly, except it got like frozen for a while but just restarted it and everything is good again."
2743,"I got this and was iffy due to the reviews but mine came with no scratches, dents, or issues. I've been using it all day and it works like brand new. I highly recommend getting this. There is no difference between this and a brand new one. Some of these reviews might be bad but this item is excellent."
2744,The phone I received was comparable to a new phone with no visible scratches or markings. Battery life is super and the phone works great. I was very happy with my purchase.
2745,"The phone is amazing. Battery was at 95%, phone was in excellent condition. Very pleased"
2746,"I had an issue with the first phone I received, it kept turning off every few minutes. I emailed customer service and they were very prompt with their response and were able to exchange it out for a new on right away. The second phone I received is working properly so far. I would buy again from the seller."
2747,"This iPhone XR i received has been really good, i have been using for about 3 weeks now and i can honestly say i have found no fault,  this is really good value for your money"
2748,Birthday gift for my grand daughter
2749,THE PHONE CAME DIRTY. ALL THE SPEAKERS AND THE CHARGING PORT WAS FULL OF DIRT AND DEBRIS. THE LEFT BOTTON SPEAKER WAS NOT WORKING AND THE CHARGING PORT WAS SOMEHOW BROKEN BECAUSE THE CHARGING KEPT FALLING OUT. THE WERE DEEP DINGS AND VERY DEEP SCRATCHES ALL AROUND THE ALUMINUM BAND AND AND THE BACK GLASS.
2750,This is a 5 star I’m using this phone right now! And it’s awesome! I was tempted not to get it because of some of the reviews but this Phone is like brand new. Also it’s Real (tested serial number) I even dropped it 2x and didn’t crack a glass. And it’s newer than ever I love it. 🤩
2751,"I thought something would go wrong. But to my supersede everything was fine. This phone may not be new but it’s new to me! But seriously I don’t notice any cracks or scratches, the phone really looks brand new. I got my XR 3 days after ordering and it comes in a amazon renewed box. The charger isn’t original and it didn’t cone with headphones which is okay."
2752,I need the previous owner iCloud I don’t know what to do. The description says it’s unlocked which clearly mine is not.
2753,"The phone was for our elderly Mom, she is familiar with Apple since she has IPad so we thought an Apple iPhone would be the logical one and it seems to be working well for her."
2754,I was skeptical after reading some reviews but when it came I was impressed. There was no scratches at all and it looked brand new. Came with a generic charger (not original) but that was specified in the description but it charged pretty fast in my opinion and the battery lasts all day so that’s a plus.
2755,"I was really concerned about buying a refurbished phone but I am so happy with this purchase.  It works perfectly, battery life and touch screen all look and work brand new!! I’ll never buy new buy new again."
2756,"Brought two of these phones for both my mom and dad. My moms worked well but straight out the box, my dad had issues with the bluetooth (the range was about 2 feet before it disconnected). He decided to take it to the shop and figure out whats wrong and turns out the motherboard was messed up. Currently working on returning the phone a week after buying it. Just know there is an actual risk you are taking by buying this refurbished phone compared to a new one."
2757,"I bought the yellow XR. I LOVE IT. The phone was shipped the SAME day. It arrived two days after I purchased it. It came with a 100% capacity battery, which lasts all day long, with high usage. Not a single scratch, ding or dent on the phone. Screen was perfect. Camera & sound quality are pretty decent. Sometimes you take a chance with refurbished electronics, but this was definitely worth the buy!!"
2758,"It was a refurb phone, but I've dealt with factory refurbs in the past and have had no issue. Not a big complainer on my end, but lets face it- phones are expensive nowadays and one deserves to see their money well spent. The phone was in typical refub condition, a few small scratches on the rim of the frame (find, no complaints here), BUT when I powered on the phone and saw the apple (the rest of the screen is black) I knew something was off. There was this small ""rainbow-esque"" circle just to the right of the Apple logo which told me right away that the screen was replaced and not done properly. Sending it back and maybe thinking about giving them another chance.  Other than the screen issue, the phone came as described. Could have done a little better job insulating the phone in general, it was literally in factory ziplock bag and inside a box- so it was able to move around a lot. Hope this helps."
2759,I paid $500 for this phone for my daughter.  It worked fine for only one year.  One morning she went to use it and it would not leave the apple screen.  We took it to the Apple store and they said it was damaged hardware inside the phone could not be fixed.  They couldn't even get into the phone to reset it for a trade in.  Had to spend another $700 for another phone. My advice.....Don't get a used phone.
2760,"Dead pixel!  This can be seen in the photo.  What a pity, I'm very upset!!! There are scratches on the bezel of the iPhone.  The entire back panel is covered in small scratches.  Battery 89%.  The phone works fine.  I do not recommend the seller.  The phone in this condition should be on sale at a discount."
2761,We got this phone for my 13 yr old grandson & he is very happy with it!
2762,Amazing for a refurbished phone
2763,It was in near perfect condition - a very minimal scuff in the top right corner but something you can’t when the screen is on. No scratches or dents. I popped my SIM right in and it worked immediately. No issues here. I will update before my 90 day warranty is up if anything happens but everything is looking perfect so far. ❤️
2764,"Ese teléfono se daño de una vez no se que le paso,entonces recomiendo que cuando vendan algún producto de Apple sea original de la fábrica pues ese es bastante dinero para perderle asi,no se vale."
2765,Didn’t like that it stopped charging after a few weeks
2766,"Recieved phone in almost perfect condition. Exactly as described. Connected well, no issues whatsoever. 2 days with the phone so far. Super fast shipping, it arrived a day early."
2767,I got this for my husband and it arrived in perfect condition my first time buying an unlocked phone and I was worried at first but it was super easy to get his Verizon phone switched over to this in less than a few minutes it arrived looking like new definitely a great purchase and I would definitely buy another phone like this again the next time we need one!
2768,"Great product, I’ve had it for 5 months now. Only thing is battery life goes fast but that’s iPhone for you. Seller is great, and phone is great for the price. I haven’t had any problems other than maybe 5 times it’s frozen for like 15 seconds, other than that it functions like new. For a refurbished phone this is great, a significantly lower price for the quality product apple makes."
2769,
2770,La batería llego al 100% la pantalla en perfecto estado sin signos de haber sido usado antes !! Como nuevo llego.. quede muy conforme !! Excelente servicio la verdad !! Desbloqueado totalmente lo uso en Paraguay
2771,She likes it but the speaker is fussy. Got it for my girlfriend for Christmas
2772,"I wasn’t worried, because of all the great reviews I read on here. My phone came within 4 days, excellent delivery speed. It comes with a really nice charger as well. I’ve seen people give 4 star reviews because it doesn’t come with headphones, but it says that it doesn’t. So this is a heads up 🤣 No scratches at all. 10000% worth it"
2773,"I was reluctant to buy a phone online but I am very satisfied with my purchase! To be honest I was impressed. It has good battery life, the touchscreen is working and the screen quality is awesome."
2774,"Really great phone if it’s in good condition..Mine has no scratches , a well functioning system and batteryI highly recommend reviewing your specific seller before buying a refurbished phone“Hybrid IT” is doing a really great job with quality of products and Customer Service"
2775,I loved how the phone looked as if it was brand new and I got it for $360. Everything was great when I got it. The shipping came extremely fast.
2776,"This seller and the ""Amazon Renewed"" program are amazing.  Very impressed with all aspects of this purchase - looks and works exactly like a new iPhone (but for a lot less)!  ""Unlocked"" ensures the phone will work with any plan - but there was a $16 fee for me to have ATT enable my old SIM to be switched and working with the new phone."
2777,"Buying expensive items like this from any online places always makes me skeptical. However, I very much appreciated all of the reviews that were left - so now I'm leaving mine. Product arrived sooner than expected. It was in great condition and has been working just fine thus far. Would definitely recommend if looking for a cheaper alternative."
2778,All in all the phone is Greatt. It has little glitches (it freezez) time to time but nothing reatarting it wont fix. It came with a charger no headphones. Cute.
2779,"honestly my heart almost drop to my ass when i opened it luckily everything is good and such a good price, them reviews scares me lol. phone came in like it was brand new."
2780,                    The media could not be loaded.                 Everything worksThe charger it came with didn't workNo cracks or scrape looks brand new it also come with a screen protector on
2781,"Fast shipping. It looks and is like brand new. No scratches, no scuffs. Very happy with my purchase and no longer skeptical of Amazon Renewed products."
2782,The phone is perfect. Got it at a great price too.
2783,The speaker doesn't work well and the battery doesn't last long. Not really worth the price.
2784,Apart from the fact that FedEx  made one attempt to deliver a phone purchase and I had to pay almost 50 dollars more for what may or may not be the same phone I must say the phone is in excellent condition the camera quality is really good also battery life 100% . A really good buy .
2785,I love everything about this phone :)
2786,"Worth the purchase. A few minor scratches but that was to be expected. None the less, phone functions like brand new. Very impressed with the quality."
2787,Battery life only came at 90% but only paying 400$ for a almost new phone is unbeatable!
2788,Was kinda scared but everything came correct in the both the phone was also completely a blank slate and it was literally perfect.
2789,iPhone met what I needed and it’s a great price and up and running minutes out of the box.
2790,Everything on this phone was great except my left speaker went out a few days after I received it.
2791,The phone arrived quickly and looked like brand new! I’ve had it for almost a month now with no issues at all. The price in my opinion is unbeatable and I would most definitely purchase again!
2792,I was used for traveling overseas and I get this phone as unlocked but when I was thier I found is locked and I have to spend 3 time cost this phone and didn’t work at all
2793,"I received the phone and it was packaged nicely, with charger cord and block.  The body and screen of phone looked brand new, no scratches anywhere.  I did have a slight issue with my sim card not being recognized, so I contacted seller.  Tek Galaxy immediately expedited a replacement to me and it worked great!  They were very polite and handled this in a professional and courteous manner - I would recommend Tek Galaxy to anyone."
2794,It was nice just had little bit of scratches on the side but it was nice
2795,"This phone is a good phone and it work great but it came with a big crack on the back. I would just take that into account when buying this phone. Otherwise, the screen was in great condition and it works great!"
2796,I was soooo nervous buying this phone but I am so glad I did! The screen has no cracks and is very smooth to the touch. The battery seems fine. Charger works fine. I am very satisfied with my purchase
2797,It works like new perfectly fine.
2798,"Looks, feels and works like brand new! I have no complaints."
2799,"Phone is unlocked only to certain carriers even though it was advertised as “unlocked for all carriers”.Problem is phone is not compatible to Sprint/T-Mobile. Although reasonably priced, it was a waste of my time and disappointed my 12 year old daughter as her surprise."
2800,Equipo sin defectos.  Vida útil de la batería 85% exelente calidad de pantalla.
2801,The phone came in perfect condition. The only thing i didn’t like is it didn’t come with a supporting charger or headphones.
2802,Phones were like brand new.  One of the returned phones was 10 less turn in b/c of a tiny scratch but other than that the transaction was smooth and really nice phone.
2803,"Ordered the premium renewal, 64 GB and it came with 98% battery efficiency. Arrived on time, good packaging. Everything works perfectly fine as if new, couldn’t have asked for a better deal"
2804,Phone shipped out Monday I received it Wednesday . So far no issues I was able to put my sim in and just use the phone. No damage perfectly good phone. I will be reordering for my son soon.
2805,                    The media could not be loaded.                 So grateful that this was everything that described get your phoneIt shipped quicklyI received itIt was packaged great and I’m extremely pleased just get you some headphones and the original charger but for the price! It’s def worth it extremely pleased and grateful
2806,"Love love love this phone!! I was definitely skeptical being I have tried a refurbished phone before and it wouldn’t work but this phone worked perfectly and I have had it for months now and no complaints!! Battery life is great, facial recognition works perfectly and the phone looked brand new, no scratches or anything!! I would highly recommend this phone and company!"
2807,This phone is great if you’re interested in a good budget and durable Iphone
2808,Bought to replace an XR that was lost in an automotive accident. Incredible quality and refurbishing.Looks and feels like brand new. Battery health is still over 95% All the buttons and screen are flawless. Truly feels like a phone straight from the factory.
2809,The first phone they shipped wasn’t compatible with my wireless service but they were happy to ship a replacement out right away and this one works great.
2810,I am so happy with my product. Phone came with not one issue I swear it looks as if I literally just purchased it from store. I dont understand why anyone would give low rating complaining about charger being factory charger when everything was explained in description. Product came super early and even gave me a screen saver. Definitely purchasing from this dealer again
2811,Really like this product. Its only been a month but its performing very well. I also got a free case with it that wasnt mentioned so i have an extra case so thats really nice. 10/10 would recommend
2812,Amazing phone. For this price I highly recommend choosing chubbiestech. I saw some reviews before purchasing that said their phones came in broken but mine came with 100% battery capacity and flawless screen and camera. I’m extremely satisfied with what they sent me.
2813,Works great!
2814,The phone looks better than I thought it would!
2815,Just like a brand new phone! The renewed are always hit and miss and this one was a hit!! Love it and it’s been almost 6 months I think! No problems
2816,phone is really good and no scratches or cracks at all! had to go to sprint because you can’t go from an 8 plus to an X series and still use the same sim card. Sim card costed 10 bucks so no worries. phone was fully unlocked and everything as advertised!
2817,Good phone waited 2 weeks to write a review case of the phone was scratched but I have a case on it and I’m happy that the screen is new love it besides the battery because it only has a 96% battery health and I know it’s going to drop fast in a few years
2818,I like the price and shipping speed.
2819,"I recently received the phone and came across 0 issues and the people who sold it are very nice and answer your questions! They also gave extra things like a phone case and screen protector, very nice!"
2820,"I received a really nice black iphone xr, there were no scratches or dents or any other visible imperfections on my phone. I have had it for 2 days and has been working with no problems. I am really happy I made this purchase. Thank you."
2821,"Phone dies once it reaches anywhere from 12-20% battery life. No warning. Also needs to be charged all night and a few hours during the day after use. Didn’t realize it was used when I purchased it, there were scuff marks all around the edges. Not a very happy camper here."
2822,I’ve been researching what phone to get and I knew I wanted this phone. I loved the yellow color. The phone arrived safely and not damaged at all. It looks and works like a brand new phone from Apple. I was really surprised the phone was refurbished. Totally worth the money. It came quickly and came with all the accessories I needed. Good buy and great phone!
2823,"I got my order way before the estimated delivery! My order came in good condition, no scratches or cracks, which is great! It works well and the item was in safe packaging. I highly recommend ordering!"
2824,"After reading some reviews I took a chance. I brought an iPhone XR for my son and thought I was saving some $$$. Out the box the phone looked brand new. It was clean with no scratches. But when I put his SIM card in, the carrier network wasn’t working. The phone’s description says that it’s fully unlocked. I was going to take it to his carrier, but then I noticed the haptics (vibration) doesn’t work."
2825,It had a small blemish on the back but there was no other blemishes. It works significantly better than my old iphone 8. I would buy through amazon renewed again.
2826,The phone worked fine. I’m returning because it wasn’t enough of an upgrade for me. Going back to get the iPhone 11. It worked fine with my Cricket service.
2827,Despite being a renewed phone and some minor barely visible scratches on the screen it works great and it was compatible with my phone carrier metro pcs plus I like how they package it with a fast charger which charges it pretty quick
2828,"The phone was in perfect condition and after about 15 minutes time I had installed sim card from old phone to new phone and everything worked perfectly,"
2829,Phone looks new works perfectly.
2830,"This arrived a day early, which was awesome because I had crushed my previous phone, and I was having to use an I-Phone 6. Looks and performs like a new phone.  Best price I could find on Amazon."
2831,"It was nice getting what I paid for.  It was for a teenager who was extremely happy with it. If she's happy, I'm happy. Aprreciate the quality service."
2832,It’s an awesome phone
2833,"This phone is like brand new love everything about it, I had order the phone wasn’t working properly they send a next 1 out to me an it works very good it’s been over 2 months now an I don’t have a problem with it if you have any second thought about buying this phone please don’t just go ahead an buy you won’t be disappointed."
2834,The battery last longer than i expected and what not.
2835,The phone work fine had no problems with it. Got it a case and screen protector it was perfect. Till a glass of water split on the table and of course the phone and it stop working within 15 minutes. Who knew
2836,"Looks great, performs great. Very pleased with purchase, Setup instructions would have been helpful but Google helped me find the answers to my questions,  I'll definitely go to Cellcow for my next upgrade!"
2837,the phone itself was fine but no where was I told that it was network locked and the sellers would not help me unlock it
2838,"Four stars because the fedex that was used to ship was terrible. Would have preferred USPS or UPS. However, the phone looks amazing and is working great so far. Wonderful communication with seller and I would recommend."
2839,There was some scratches in the back of it but over all it’s pretty good. The battery health was at 91% when I first got it
2840,The phone came in good condition the only issue is the battery capacity was 87 when I first got it
2841,"El telèfono llegò mucho antes de la fecha que me dijeron. Ademàs que aparte del telèfono y cargador, trajo y cover antishock y un screen protector, no me lo esperaba. La calidad del telèfono es impresionante. No me arrepiento."
2842,"Love it ! Came early , came with a screen protector & all ! no scratches or dents !!! & i have the product red 😍😍😍 ! came from the coral to red , i love it so much better ❤️ ! thankyouuu! definitely would buy again & recommend!"
2843,I was in doubt when I purchase this item but it was all a false alarm. The product came in like it was brand new their were no scratches anywhere and the accessories are complete and in good condition. The phone was also unlocked already so it save me fortune. I am really thankful!
2844,"First time buying used phone online, was nervous. But super glad that I did it! I LOVE my phone. It looks brand new. Works great and even came with case and screen protector . Would buy again !"
2845,Great phone so far! Came with a charger. Also came with a phone contract trial which I didn’t need because I have att I went from an iPhone 8 Plus to the iPhone XR which I was not so sure about but still no difference from the iPhone 11 so I’m glad  I made the right choice!
2846,"Im just gonna be honest, i feel like with this product it is hit or miss. mine came in in perfect condition, in one day. its worked amazing and honestly i would recommend this seller. but after reading other comments i assume you have a chance of getting a dud phone. so buy at your own risk but everything was perfect for me:)"
2847,Absolutely love the phone ! No scratches or problems with it. Turned it on it had a full battery. Took it to my carrier and got it connected with no problem.
2848,"I just got it today, there are a few scratches and dents but merely visible and the batter health is 93%. I love it! ❤️"
2849,"The cosmetic appearance was almost flawless. On the back, there are tiny chips but almost invisible. The performance is flawless m. Cannot tell the difference from a new one. I will be a persistent customer."
2850,On initial start up there’s a giant dead pixel area. Submitted a request for a replacement. Very disappointed with this obvious bad screen that should have been caught.
2851,We bought three of these for our teenagers. Great mid level iPhone for the kids. They're thrilled with them and have had no troubles in the three months since we bought them.
2852,Received the phone 2 days after it was supposed to arrive. Back of the phone was cracked as in picture. I asked for a overnight replacement or discount for cracked phone. Could not be guaranteed either from Amazon. Kept phone since it’s for my 16 year old but buyer beware you could end up with a broken phone. We’re putting ours in an otter box so my son didn’t mind.
2853,"Can’t complain, looks and works like new, no oem charger but it did have the SIM card tool and a tempered glass cover.  Battery life is about like average, there were a few smuggs on the glass but overall good.  It’s a good value."
2854,This was a gift for my niece’s 15th birthday. The phone looks and functions like a brand new phone!!! She is so happy and in love with this phone!!!
2855,We have had the phones for a week and they work great. Mini scuffs but all in all they are in great condition and work great.  Delivered a day early!!!
2856,Really good I loved it I got the black iPhone XR ! No scratches! My battery percentage was 100% which is really good! Came in 2 days way earlier then expected! Really good presentation works really well by far I’ve had it for a day and I’m super satisfied with the results so worth the money and it worked with my cricket carrier! :) super good job love it!
2857,Very happy with the phone
2858,"The iPhone XR was a Present for Mother’s Day and was Like New!  Worked great and processed Insanely faster than its iPhone 6 Plus replacement.  Camera was great and easily backed up data from old iPhone.  The battery was in red when first opened, but nothing a simple charging didn’t correct.Highly recommend this product"
2859,love the phone would definitely buy from this company again.
2860,Phone came in almost perfect condition battery’s at 85% and there’s a couple scuffs on the screen nothing that I’m too in a huff over. Beautiful device 10/10 would def recommend!
2861,"I love the bigger screen size, touch screen is flawless. Videos are very nice. I don’t use my TV hardly at all. Mostly my phone to watch movies. Battery is better than average"
2862,I was hesitant bit am thoroughly impressed with the quality of my XR iPhone!  Vendor provided extra speedy service too!!!!
2863,"My daughter saved her money all summer to purchase the phone. She was so happy when it arrived. Product was in great condition, no scratches or dents and it worked perfectly! It was such a good experience I just purchased one for myself, should receive it this week."
2864,No complaints
2865,"I got this phones over a week now and I must say I’m really in love with how it shipped and how good they packed it, it even came with an case which I was happy about.... they only thing I dislike is the battery life it gets low very easily😢"
2866,This is Soo good !!! It was suppose to come next week but ended up coming a week earlier I got this for my granddaughter and she loved it . Buy this product it's not a scam !!
2867,Came in a generic box and had both a generic charger and brick. Phone back and front glass is pristine and a few corners have  a couple of scuffs. Battery was at %91 pretty good buy but always remember it’s a gamble
2868,"Good phone. Bought for my Mom. She likes the bigger screen, she had an iPhone 5. Got the att version, no problems hooking it up. Not one scratch or blemish, looks brand new. Came in generic box with charger and sim pin. Have bought phones from this seller before, always done me right."
2869,My grandson use for school pictures. He loves it!
2870,Everything works perfectly fine. I am glad I decided to take the chance and get this phone as I am super satisfied.
2871,I have been using this phone for past 5 months now with complete satisfaction. No issues and Value for money.
2872,"Great phone just not with the hype of iPhones themself, lol. That’s just me as a person. I’ve had it for a month or so now, I got exactly what I ordered. This phone looks and functions as if purchased from Apple themselves, in other words like new. I would definitely recommend this seller. 👍🏾👍🏾"
2873,"Renewed product pretty much like new only downside was 90% battery capacity, overall great price! It's important to mention the seller so people might find it useful and buy from them. I got mine from Chubbiestech"
2874,The phone was a A+ renewed quality the only issue was on us the buyer. My wife ordered a iPhone XR instead of a iPhone XS. I would definitely recommend this vendor in future or for family.
2875,worked good for a couple months then all the sudden i get locked out my phone and there apple id and phone number is connected to the phone so i cant fix it and they wont text me back.
2876,"I hesitated a ton buying this phone renewed, constantly reading other reviews, videos about buying Iphones online but I finally decided to go through with it since I had Amazon's return policy to give me confidence. Once I received the package, I found I had nothing to worry about at all, it arrived in amazing condition, with a charger and wall adapter; I would recommend buying Amazon renewed Iphones to anyone now, no regrets whatsoever and I saved money!"
2877,The back of the phone came with scratches but I wasn’t noticeable and sometimes the sound doesn’t work but just have to plug and unplug my headphones but everything else was perfect👍🏼
2878,"Very fast shipping, ordered on a Monday told it would arrive on Thursday. Phone arrived on Wednesday. No damage like others reported works and runs like brand new. Very pleasant experience."
2879,I was nervous to order a phone off Amazon but I don’t regret it. Came with charger. Switched to my carrier. Texting this review with it right now.
2880,overall the phone is good.  I have encountered a problem with the camera on the get go but thought it would fix it self.  The problem is this when i am ready to take a picture it freezes and I have to shut the camera and after I try to take the picture again it works.  its very frustrating because I sometimes I really miss  good shots.  This is very disappointing....
2881,"The phone was in perfect condition. I have no complaints. I love my new phone, it arrived early & I would purchase again. Also came with a screen protector installed."
2882,Phone was in excellent condition and good battery life
2883,"To Avant Solutions - I am very disappointed with the quality of this iPhoneXR and request a replacement. The issue is the touchscreen. It is very unresponsive to the touch. It has to be pressed very hard multiple times to function like a normal iPhone. Since this iPhone doesnt have a home button and swipes control it, it is very frustrating to use due to the lack of screen response. It has to be touched over and over harder and harder for the simplest swipe or movement. Looking at it very closely, it has bubbles under it at the bottom as if the glass was crudely replaced. This would explain the poor performance of the touchscreen. Requested a better quality replacement iPhoneXR from the Vendor."
2884,Great phone. Look new and work great so far
2885,"Got this phone for my daughter and she has been super happy with it - arrived promptly and works great, as described."
2886,
2887,The phone had no scratches and it was true to the description. It was easy to set up and the phone arrived a day early. So far I have no complaints about the phone.
2888,It’s good. Comes with no headphones but that doesn’t really matter to me. Great deal!
2889,"I purchased this phone for a friend that lost her phone and she hasn’t had any issues with it so far! Once you receive the phone, it comes factory reset like a brand new iPhone from your provider or the apple store. I plan on purchasing any phone for myself from now on like I did with this phone."
2890,Great phone and great customer service!
2891,"Got the phone today and everything seems to be working fine, out the sim in and it was ready to go, not scratch or anything looks brand new. Will update if anything happens.."
2892,"The phone looks new, no scratches, no worn signs for a very reasonable price and it works just fine; very happy customer."
2893,"Sold and Ship by Amazon. Be Aware! Returned this item the next day and Amazon recieved the item back but demanded 30 days to refund the money and still waiting for it. The battery life was terrible in this renewed premium XR. Returned right away. Also, oddly enough, few of my accounts were hacked after installing and logging into them from this phone. Lesson here, there is always a chance for renewed phones to have been tampered with  either by the original seller, third party renewer, or resaler."
2894,This phone is just like new; couldn’t be happier!
2895,"I know it says renewed, and I expected maybe a blemish or - something - but the one I received looks brand new & works great."
2896,The iPhone XR is fabulous.  However. I do not recommend buying refurbished. I bought one thru Amazon a week before Christmas and it works with the exception of voice calls.  I can barely hear callers even though the volume is at at max.  I have to use speaker phone method if I want to hear incoming or outgoing calls.
2897,The phone is perfect but battery life is at 90 and the charger that came in the box charges slow
2898,"face recognition worked perfectly, battery life is awesome and so is the screen quality! Everything was amazing and works just like brand new!"
2899,I was really nervous to get this but my cousin ordered the black one and it arrived in perfect condition so I ordered the white on it looked brand new was fully unlocked and the set up was super simple. Headphones aren’t included and it doesn’t come in the original box or charger but that was a problem for me
2900,I love this phone so much! I definitely recommend this and this was a great upgrade from a 6 to an XR. Had no scratches what so ever and works perfectly. Battery life is really long too. Doesn’t come with original box or charger but that doesn’t bother me. Also doesn’t come with headphones but that’s completely fine with me. Still a perfect lovely phone!
2901,"I was very concerned about purchasing the device on Amazon after reading some terrifying reviews. I received my phone in good condition it looks practically new, setup process was easy and smooth. I haven’t experienced any issues yet. I’m very happy with the purchase. I upgraded my moms from a 6S Plus to the XR she loves it."
2902,"Just very irritating to be locked into Apple's ecosystem when using their phones.  But that's how they make their money, right?  Get you locked into using all of their proprietary software and then, before you know it, everything you own is Apple.  Not because it's superior technology... but because it's ""Apple""."
2903,I bought the white iPhone XR as a gift for my sister. We live in Jamaica so I needed an unlocked version to work with our local carriers. I was worried at first but when I got it I was relieved. I got exactly what the description states and the phone was and still is in great condition. Good quality at a great price. Thank you!
2904,"The phone seems near new conditions, but one of the speakers on the left side don’t work, not a big deal, but just be aware a small flaw can be there"
2905,Wasn’t pleased with the scratches on the phone but everything else is good.
2906,Love this product I got it in red. Came with minor scratches that are not really noticeable at all. Battery health was at 97% and lasts all day. Would recommend to any future buyers.
2907,Very satisfied customer! I’ve been plugging away with an iPhone 6 for years and finally decided it was time for an upgrade but no way was I about to pay 1000 + for a phone. The phone looks and behaves like new!! Happy girl 😊
2908,Was a little skeptical to buy a renewed phone but it came in pristine condition and has worked perfectly. It was packaged in generic Amazon packaging with an Amazon brand charger. It did not include EarPods. But for the price it was a great deal for primarily the phone.  I’ll update down the road if any issues pop up with the phone. But so far so good.
2909,I returned this because the IPhone had a bunch of scratches and it looked like it had been through a lot.  It didn’t look like it was well taken care of andIt was going to be a gift for a friend that had a really old phone.  I was really disappointed in getting this.
2910,I liked the iphoneXR... everything worked fine with the phone.  The power cable was a disappointment..didn't work and was from some ROKU system or unit.... looked crappy and overused from some old system!
2911,"My husband enjoys the phone very much. He is still getting used to having no ""Home"" button. Overall, the phone is in great shape, it works great, and we have nothing to complain about."
2912,I was hesitant to get a refurbished phone after reading some of the comments but I went forward with the purchase any way.  I'm glad I did as the phone was in near perfect condition.
2913,OMGG LIKE THIS IS AMAZING! DONT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!! IT CAME PERFECTLY WITH EVERYTHING IT NEEDED! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
2914,"The first phone I purchased from this company, the screen arrived with a very small ding in the screen. I signed up for an exchange and in the meantime $400 of my money was tied up until a new one arrived. When the new one arrived, the same thing happened in the screen cracked within minutes of opening the box. Initially, I thought it was a screen cover they put over the phone that was cracking. As time went on I realize this was not just the screen cover, this was actually the screen that was cracking. Even with a caisson  and barely any use the screen cracks and gets little dings. This company sells refurbished phones with very cheap iPhone screens that crack and break extremely easily. Buyer beware, don’t buy a phone from this company because they use super cheap parts! This is the second phone I bought that the screen broke within moments of opening."
2915,"The phone was great came with a screen protector, a great case, and a charger. I recommend this if you are looking for a great iPhone XR. It had very minor nearly unnoticeable scratches but overall great."
2916,I have used this phone for two days so far and its great. The battery life is super good with the capacity of 91%. No dents or cracks. I bought this phone from the seller BuySpry.
2917,"This is the best phone I have ever bought off Amazon. The phone is just like new, the camera quality is amazing. The battery last me through a 10/12 hour shift. I would definitely buy again."
2918,"I thought this was a bit risky looking at the 5% of bad reviews. Trust me it is worth it. My iPhone XR came with no scratches, dents, or cracks. It had 100% batter life and is the best phone I ever had. Do not listen to the bad reviews."
2919,"Received the phone. Attempted to update to latest version. After 3 hrs of updating, phone said I needed a service provider to update further. Took it to provider and the provider said the phone needed repair. All the buttons on the side were not working. A little friendly word of advice to a potential buyer, if you’re looking for a great paper weight and like waisting time and money, I highly recommend this paperweight. If you’re looking for a phone, you’d be better off with 2 cups and a string. Note to phone seller, ya might want to actually check the paperweights that you’re sending out. I’m sending this pos that you sent me back and not paying a cent. It’s locked with a password and there was nothing that could be done about that. Your problem, not mine."
2920,Phone works fine except for blown speakers. Cannot play music or take calls on speaker mode without it sounding miserable
2921,i love it!
2922,"Love this phone. Can’t tell it’s not new. The only issue I had was no ear phones. I picked the color, coral and love it."
2923,i have enjoyed this phone
2924,No complaints so far. Pretty good for the cost
2925,Arrived fast and my daughter loves it!
2926,"Battery life was supposed to be %100 but when I received it, it was only 90. But over all great phone, no scratches or dings. Love it!"
2927,For a refurbished phone I wasn't expecting a whole lot. to my surprise this phone is just like my old iPhone when I bought it brand new! I am so impressed and very happy with my purchase! I highly recommend this seller!!!! A1!!!!!!!!!👍😊
2928,It was deffective
2929,"Bought this phone for my daughter, I couldn't tell it was renewed, looks great ,battery life still good, everything works, first-time buyer,going to purchase another."
2930,works great as good as new one
2931,The phone came in two days early and it's like bran new I happy I bought this off this seller it was worth my time thank you
2932,iPhone was in excellent condition
2933,Casi como nuevo a nivel estetico. Me vino 88% la bateria.Super rápido el envío a miami.
2934,"It’s a very nice phone but it didn’t come with any earphone or the official apple box just the phone itself,charger and SIM card remover. It’s a of brands iPhone but still an iPhone kind of"
2935,"Gave it to my mom for Christmas she loved it and it looked brand new straight from the apple store!!!!! No problems whatsoever, just backed her phone up and switched all at home. Def. recommend!!"
2936,My 4th Amazon refurbished iPhone.  The phone is perfect.  Not a mark on it.  Battery is perfect and lasts all day.  Simply pop in your sim and you’re in business.  Highly recommend
2937,Phone came in perfect condition with a screen protector already on it !
2938,only problem is that battery life is around 70%
2939,Bought this phone for my daughter was nervous after reading some of the reviews but the phone was in great condition and we had no problems getting it turned on with metro pcs
2940,I needed a new phone. I decided to get it and really like the phone. My first one the speaker didn’t work had to send back. Customer service was great and my second phone hasn’t given me any trouble.
2941,"I really enjoy this phone! The only negative review I have thus far would be that phone calls are difficult to hear from both ends making it incapable to converse. Unfortunately I am forced to return it , However I would like to try repurchasing this phone. Hopefully the next phone will be thoroughly inspected  preventing any further issues(:"
2942,Phone came in good condition no scuffs or scratches. Also has a great battery life. I would 100% recommend people to purchase this phone
2943,"I don’t really use the phone like most people, so I am really unable to say anything about battery life. Days could go by before I even turn on my phone.The phone has meet my expectations."
2944,Good
2945,"The only reason it didn’t get a five was because the bottom was scuffed up pretty noticeably.I got this for my son for Christmas and he’s loving it. Functions perfectly, no technical issues at all. Fast delivery!"
2946,"Everything works great, good quality"
2947,"Iphone came as if it were brand new, battery came at 93% and everything works as its supposed to. 10/10 would reccomend"
2948,"Acabo de recibir el paquete, un gran smartphone a un precio accesible, mínimos detalles estéticos, la pantalla intacta y cristal trasero igual para ser reacondicionado, lo unico que me decepcionó es el porcemtaje de batería en 83% esperana in 86% mínimo"
2949,This iPhone XR is way better than my iPhone 7 battery life is longer than the iPhone 7
2950,"not a scam! ordered this & delivery was super fast for having to travel across the United States. a lot of people don’t realize refurbished phones don’t come with original Apple cord/headphones or SIM card, I thought that was obvious but looking at other reviews I guess not lol. Comes with a very long, I believe 10 foot charger, and charging block. in perfect condition, unlocked. high recommend"
2951,The face wasn’t too bad but it wasn’t a good phone l lost my money the phone was garbage and the worst thing about it I buy it to use it Jamaica I just leave it down there if I could get my money back or a different phone 📱 then that would be nice
2952,                    The media could not be loaded.                 I see no scratches and batter life is 91%. However I received the item with screen time password on. Amazon customer care people have asked me to return the item since they can’t unlock it.
2953,"It Came In 2 Days Early , And Was Brand New Completely"
2954,It’s good
2955,"I purchased the iPhone XR unlocked, phone overall in great condition, a few scratches on the screen not real bad or that noticeable, battery health 90% arrived early. I’m happy! thanks 😁"
2956,It was a great improvement over the phone I had before
2957,Needed a replacement phone and this one was like new! Everything is in like new condition a d works perfect as expected
2958,"This phone is amazing, works perfectly fine. Next time just hope the date of delivery is correct but other than that I have no problems at all. Definitely recommend"
2959,I liked that the phone was unlocked to be used with any carrier but the only problem that I had was that it came without the original package which for a second thought I was not real till I opened it. It did came with a charger but no headphones. I'm still happy that I got a phone unlocked that I couldn't get stores close to me.
2960,"Phone arrived as Holiday present. Screen condition was acceptable, not as good as had hoped for per the description (Good condition with minimal defects not visible at a certain distance but there were some defects visible at all distances including one specific defect that obscured some of the battery strength). Since it was a gift and unable to return in time we decided to continue with it. Functionality had no issues over the first few months until the last several weeks the phone has had some charging issues (not charging and battery losing charge rapidly). Now we have a battery error statement and iPhone cannot recognize this battery as a genuine iPhone battery. We are outside of the return window so have contacted Apple. I will update my review when we learn of the problem and how / if we can remedy it. Disappointed with the product and wish i had returned it originally when first received."
2961,"I selected white as my color choice, I received a black phone. That's not a big deal, I just didn't receive what I asked for. Also, it's kind of glitchy and slow. There is a scratch on the screen and a small space of dead pixel. It's not terrible, but it's really not worth $450+. I'm just going to bite the bullet and buy a new phone once my refund is processed."
2962,"Refurbished iPhone - wasn’t cleaned that well - still had dead skin and dander in the earpiece, one side of the speakers on bottom doesn’t seem to work, and the screen has some scratches in it. It’s better then the phone that I had and it was affordable at the time."
2963,"I am very happy with the acquisition of my iPhone XR. It is exactly or better than it was presented to me. New phone, great price and apple quality, ¿what else can I ask for? Love this great deal. Thank you."
2964,Phone works perfectly fine !
2965,Works great so far. Few scuffs but not noticeable. Thank you 😊
2966,"Bought for my son, he’s only had a few days: It came in perfect condition, so far, no noted issues."
2967,Tbh I love the phone nothing has happened so far just got mine today but wondering why people are giving it bad reviews but in any case love the phone 👍
2968,"Very satisfied, phone looks new...."
2969,"The phone is great, came in good packaging and I love it. The battery life is also great on one full charge all day"
2970,"Worst experience since purchasing on Amazon, two month into using the phone the screen went completely blank, had to purchase a replacement."
2971,"I’ve had this phone for almost a year now, and have had no problems! The battery still lasts all day, and the face recognition works great with no problems."
2972,Great phone. This is my first iphone. I have always had android. So far so good... Also came 4 days early!!!--
2973,"Very minor scratch on screen otherwise in perfect condition. 89% battery health, seller included glass screen protector. Can’t beat it for the price. Go get one."
2974,"Muy bien producto, un poco de arañado en las esquinas pero no para nada. El cargador no funcionaba"
2975,"Great phone. Works great. Probably will get beat to death by software updates once Apple comes out with the 12 or 13 because Apple does that a lot. So as long as you remember that it will be forced into obsolescence within a couple years, it’s great."
2976,"I live in Liberia so it took a while to get the phone. My sister received after I paid for it and  Mom brought it on her way back home. I must admit, the phone is like brand new. There’s not a single scratch on it and I t works pretty well. The seller is highly recommended as long as their products are like mine."
2977,For me the battery capacity was 95%. I know somebody who tried Amazon renewed with an older device and the battery capacity was lower so that’s something to consider. No blemishes. Probably best iPhone to buy in late 2020.
2978,I like the phone. I don’t have a long battery life and I’m making adjustments.
2979,"new battery. they repainted the phone, but everything else works great."
2980,Overall I give this phone great props ! BUT for me to pay almost 400$ for the phone and it have white spots in the screen is crazy
2981,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing this phone because of the mixed reviews, but I’m so glad I did. If your on the fence about purchasing it don’t be. Go for it"
2982,"Came in an Amazon package, but phone was received as described. It does not come with SIM card, so beware.I put the SIM card from the old phone into the I11 and setup with flawlessly."
2983,Bought it for a fami member to upgrade them from their 6S. Phone works with no hassle so I'm cool with that. Delivery took a little while tho but that's possibly due to the Christmas rush.
2984,"Dark shadow in corner of the screen, sent back for this issue, reordered same type phone and company still charged me a 4.95 restocking fee for sending me a defective product.UPDATEI contacted the company with this issue, and they agreed to reimburse the restock fee as well."
2985,Tenía miedo d e comprarlo pero valió l apena 100%100
2986,I moved up from an iPhone 6s so no surprise this phone is awesome to me . Delivered before expected and although renewed this phone is in excellent condition. Happy to recommend seller.
2987,Battery life 93%. Few scratches on screen. Came with case and screen protector. Good speaker and camera quality. Bought as a gift. I will be purchasing one for myself soon. Came unlocked. Easy setup.
2988,"Good as new, Met my expectations. It was sim locked but I was able to get it unlocked by my carrier."
2989,"Its a good phone i like it , when i got the phone it was at 80% and it was doing automatically software update ."
2990,They came fast and we had no problem getting their service switched over. I bought them for my 14 year old twins and they love them.
2991,"After spending a day setting up my ""new"" iPhone XR, I finally got it ready to activate and use for a call. My daughter called me and I could BARELY hear her, the sound was so muffled and low in volume. When I put her on the speaker, the sound was fine. I tried several more calls to see if it was possibly her phone or even our cell coverage that was causing this issue, with the same results.When I ordered this phone, I understood that Amazon or the seller would have actually made sure that the phone was usable. It is not. I cleaned it and tried multiple ""fixes"" suggested online to no avail. I took it to Apple to see if they could fix it with software or cleaning, and they showed me a glimpse of this specific phone's previous trips to the Apple store to resolve ""sound issues.""  There were several with notes showing that poor sound quality was an issue. Shame on the seller and Amazon for taking advantage of customers by selling them junk!"
2992,Works like it’s a brand new phoneI’m always playing music on Spotify and it doesn’t need charged till I’m laying in bed
2993,"I have spent 2 weeks with the iPhone XR. No words, amazing. This looks literally like new. Everything is in perfect condition so far. Not a single scratch, the screen is original and perfect, and the cameras are PERFECT. Battery came in 100% of health and is Fully unlocked (I can use it in Venezuela, Latin America). I’m speechless!"
2994,This was the big gift for my daughter so she is ecstatic about it! The only issue is there are scratches all on the screen!!!! Cant believe it! She wont let me return because she really wants the phone but to see her face trying to get the scratches off I cant believe the disappointment.
2995,"The device was great and the battery percentage was 90 The only thing that was bad was the speaker. It seems that it was not completely clean, but in general, a cheap iPhone. This is a good thing. It was a gift for my son and he was very happy and this is what matters now"
2996,Personal useA lovely gift for my daughterShe was truly pleased
2997,I honestly thought I was going to get scammed but I was in desperate need for a bee phone so I took a chance. The phone came fully unlocked and arrived earlier than expected. Great seller.
2998,"Liked the colorLiked the phone but after 2 weeks it went haywire; switching screens while I was texting or callingI had reservations about it being refurbished, thought I would give it a try.  Buying new from now on."
2999,I’m using it right now. No complaints. It’s a gray phone and it’s a nice change from my android. I don’t have use my fingerprint to open the phone anymore.
3000,"Bought it a month ago, a good purchase. It has no cosmetic imperfect and looks brand new.Works well."
3001,"I thought it would be a scam but it wasn’t, Face ID works, 96% battery health, good screen. There was a small scrape at the bottom but it’s a refurbished phone, so it’s totally worth it."
3002,No setup instructions at all !
3003,"I took a leap of faith on this, as it is quite a bit of money up front. This was a gift for my sweet boyfriend (I myself have the XR too and love it) and this company does NOT disappoint! It was in perfect condition and looked brand spanking new. No scratches, everything in perfect working order. Thank you SO much; he loves it!"
3004,Had to return it the phone was supposed to be unlocked for T-Mobile and it wasn't it still had a lock on it
3005,"The one I received Looks just as if it were new. No damages, Wirks perfectly , and has a really nice screne. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get this phone."
3006,It’s great en all just won’t connect to car play
3007,I like that it last long and you don’t have to have it charge for a long time and the battery life will have  the the same amount of battery that you left at
3008,"Phone looks fine and works but it has a very weird problem, there’s no way to silence the camera shutter sound when taking a picture. Should be able to put the phone on silent and it silences the camera shutter sound but unfortunately it does not.My daughter wasn’t happy about that but it was an inconvenience to mail it back, wait for a refund and find another one so she’s just keeping it.I wish it was in like new condition as the ad stated and the phone functioned correctly in all aspects."
3009,Received phone and it was locked. Call the number on the instructions received and they tried to get me to unlock it myself. I returned it and waiting on two weeks and still haven’t gotten my money back
3010,The apple I phone xr was a great purchase.  The battery life is great.  I was little leary of buying a renewed phone but I was impressed by the overall quality of the phone.
3011,"I was nervous about buying this phone at first, but I’m really glad I did. It functions exactly as it should and it’s really great so far. I basically got a $700 for $500. The only bad thing is that Boost Mobile wouldn’t accept it, but I ended up getting a better deal from Verizon anyways."
3012,"I ordered this phone in white and it came in the black, but other than that looks practically brand new other than a few small scratches on the screen if you look really close. Came with charger/cube."
3013,Had this a couple of months now. Beat the heck out of paying $1000 for a new phone. I’m happy with this for 1/2 the price.
3014,"It’s great, it came with no scratches or smudges. One thing, just don’t use the charger it comes with, sense it’s not an apple adapter it will effect the quality of how your phone charges with a real apple charger. otherwise it great! still five stars, totally recommend it"
3015,I just received my phone so far I like it. It wwsnt no scratches or dents in the phone looks new. The camera is not the best but it will do. It was unlocked all I had to do was sign in and it came right on. Switch my sim card and I'm using my phone fine I love it
3016,"This is the second restored iPhone I have purchased from Amazon.  Both times they have come looking and wrapped like new.  They work wonderfully, and the new size is still a weight that is comfortable.  I am pushing 80 and I can't understand people my age being afraid of electronics.  I couldn't be without my iPhone."
3017,"Phone appeared in perfect condition, but never worked properly after about a week or two, just went dead, and then  when finally getting to 'wake up' it redialed 911 many times. Ouch. Refurbished  is a chance.....but may re-orer to get lucky. Price and delivery was great!"
3018,"Fast shipping, BUT Amazon keeps shipping all my packages to a house 5 houses down from mine. But the product is amazing and have been using it for about a month now and I have had no problems!"
3019,"the iphone is NOT unlocked, it is blocked by AT&T and I can't do anything because it has a debit balance in the account"
3020,I’m from Trinidad and Tobago I recommend anyone to buy this! Works like new!
3021,Toaster it has properly functioned
3022,It seems that the battery for each model is different and manufacturer doesn’t produce any new batteries after a model is replaced with a new-better model
3023,"Came without any scratches or dents. Works great after I realized the SIM card goes in with the gold panel facing upwards. Received a month ago with 93% battery life. After a month use of charges with USB C 18W cable, battery life is the same."
3024,My phone came today (the day I’m writing this review) in new condition and it’s fully unlocked! It has no scratches or cracks and it was 84% charged when it was delivered. It also came wit a screen protector on it which was a bonus! 10/10 would recommend this company as my mom also purchased a phone from them.
3025,"I received this phone around a week ago and wanted to fully test it before I wrote my review. Let me say straight out, I LOVE IT! I haven’t had any problems with anything. The quality is amazing and no scratches or marks at all! I wish I could give 10 stars."
3026,At first I was skeptical of buying this phone but I’ve been using it for a month now and it’s in flawless condition I definitely recommend buying it.
3027,"Phone works very well : ) phone came with a chip on the ring around the camera, so I was bummed about that. However, cosmetically great besides that. Also, the charger that came with the phone does not work, so that was really aggravating."
3028,"I don’t usually write reviews but this was really great. I order my phones off of Amazon a lot and I’m skeptical every time, but I’m super happy with this phone! no damage, everything works super fast, and I got it activated through AT&T with no problems. Great product :)"
3029,"the phone is amazing, it came brand new. no scratches, cracks, or buttons missing. sound quality is amazing and face recognition works perfectly, i’m in love 💗"
3030,Great phone! No issues with service provider and it took 10 minutes. The phone has no scratches. Great condition! My daughter in-law is getting another one from same seller! 5 stars
3031,Bought as grad gift for my son. Excellent condition. Google fi doesn’t work on all iPhones and he liked the X
3032,The phone came in great condition no cracks or scratches
3033,This phone only lasted me 5 months. It keeps connecting and disconnecting from the internet. The screen went half black and it also burned out.
3034,came with a bigger scratch on the screen than expected and some dirt build up on certain edges i thought would be clean but overall worth it with a amazon gift card after the holidays
3035,"Phone froze on me one time. Sometimes when I touch the screen trying to select something, it takes a while to press, but other than that it works fine."
3036,"I was skeptical of ordering a renewed phone from a seller where Amazon wasn’t fulfilling the order, but the seller (ChubbiesTech) came through with a great phone that was legit (checked the serial #, etc.)! I’ve seen no issues at all, but I’ve only had it for half a day. I’m confident it’ll last the 90-day guarantee but I’ll update the review if anything comes up. So far so good!"
3037,Purchased it for a friend as a gift and he hasn't started using it. So can't comment until he begins using it. However it looks decent from the outside.
3038,"Perfect! I bought this with hesitation because it’s a phone off of Amazon, but this product came in with a screen protector included, a 91% battery life, and no scratches at all! Everything works perfect!"
3039,See above
3040,I love the security of this phone first of all. The Face ID is awesome. I upgraded from an IPhone 6s to the IPhone XR. HUGE DIFFERENCE! Love it already! Always been an appleGuy always will!! Thank you Apple and Amazon  for the user friendly Exceptional product!
3041,Love how big it is! Bought if for the hubby for father's day. Had no issues connecting it. Everything works perfectly!
3042,"don’t waste time reading the angry reviews. they ordered a refurbished phone and that’s what they got, and a GREAT one at that."
3043,Nice phone
3044,Great phone like new perfect
3045,"The phone came in in perfect condition! Not as much as a single scratch. Battery life is great but as I started to use the phone, there are several issues. Many of my apps won’t work properly and sometimes things just won’t load for no reason. I am still using the phone though, I just wish the phone didn’t come with these minor issues. Overall, the phone is okay."
3046,I was skeptical at first but honestly it is like a brand new phone there’s nothing wrong with it! Thank you Amazon! Don’t believe the bad reviews
3047,It’s fine for now
3048,I like this model and price is good.I have purchased three for different family members.  All in great shape.

3050,"Phone keeps ghost tapping, enables you to use the phone repeatedly."
3051,"The three stars are for the post-sale support. Unfortunately I received a non-working device. I returned it the next day and within a week my refund was completed.So this may work, but if it does not, you can return the phone and get your money back."
3052,Work great
3053,"Couldn’t tell that this was a renewed product.  Not a scratch, dent or mark on the phone.  Not sure on battery life yet because we are too used to charging it incrementally throughout the day."
3054,I needed an upgrade after my iPhone 7 started to slowly stop working. I was apprehensive about buying a refurbished phone but I’m so happy with it. It looks and works like new I couldn’t be happier
3055,The charger didn’t work but the phone was great!
3056,"nothing wrong with it, and not sketchy at all. the battery was at 89% when i got it"
3057,"The iPhone XR is in excellent condition.  Strong battery, no scratches on the screen.  The phone works like it’s brand new.  I will buy from this company again. Royal"
3058,Todo bien lonunico malo es que la bateria no duran el tiempo establecido
3059,The phone is absolutely amazing! The battery life went down one percent since I had it but that’s fine. It also came with free apple care. No scratches no marks.
3060,I really loved this product. It came the day after because I ordered it for one day shipping. The screen is great and it came with a screen protector! The battery life was at 95% which was good. I bought this 2 weeks ago and it is working perfectly. Would recommend!

3062,I yike a lot berry happ tee
3063,I am so impressed. I was very skeptical to say the least in relation to the quality of device I was going to get. SO pleased!!! Fully unlocked model worked immediately with my Cricket Wireless chip. Phone and screen in perfect working condition. Instantly worked with my iPhone 7plus. All data (and photos) transferred without issue. Worth every penny!
3064,"This is NOT a scam, I received an iPhone XR used like new. No scratches dents or anything, 90% battery life and came with a charger. Phone was also unlocked as advertised, I was hesitant at first but it ended up exceeding my expectations."
3065,This was a Christmas Gift for my 16 year old Grandson.  He just loves it and says it works great. I was very pleased with the seller and the communication and fast ship.
3066,Everything seems to work like new. Battery life seems outstanding.
3067,Haven’t use the face recognition yet.Love the rest of the featuresStill learning different things about it.An instructional manual would be nice
3068,I have ordered several phones from Amazon and this phone was defective as it would not read any SIM card and the Verizon rep tried a few cards.
3069,"got it fast, nice phone. Looks new. Satisfied."
3070,This phone was better than expected. It looked very close to new. The battery condition showed in the 90% range.  The phone works with my provider as promised.

3076,"Phone was like brand new, great price and fast delivery. No problems with the cell"

3084,"Love it for my first iPhone , very much like new. Better than what I expected for the price.  No scratches and shipping was super fast !"
3085,Todo bien de momento. Intacto
3086,This iphone was really great! but there was one thing it was NOT durable i dropped once! and it was practically shattered but overall it was a good phone!
3087,THIS IS NOT A SCAM AT ALL!!! I bought this phone and it came in good condition and all I had to do was put my SIM card in it from the other phone and it worked perfectly thank you soooo much I love it.
3088,"Love it, there isn’t a headphone or original charger but I’m not worried about that. The setup was a pain but now everything is working perfectly. There are no scratches, battery life on setting says 100%. I checked the serial number, it’s legit. I do have to say, the shipping company (fedex) was horrible but that’s not on the seller. The phone is perfect."
3089,battery health was 93%. was really nice. only problem is at the bottom there’s a light/faded spot that you can sometimes see while using the screen
3090,Good to me ❤️ Hope it be good to y’all’s too
3091,"What a beautiful and excellent product, I will recommend this provider to buy the cell phones, thank you again, it works great internationally with claro ecuador, works perfect!"

3094,"Looks good so far , in pristine condition let’s hope it works well too I’ll be back to update- btw if you’re buying from a supplier buy it from Synergy! Not buyspryUpdate july 12 2022It’s been some time since I purchased this device , still works like a charm!!!.best purchase ever"
3095,Battery life still not as long as an android but better than my last two iPhones. Decent amount of storage.
3096,"The only flaw on it is couple specks in the top left corner from being dropped by the previous owner, but I honestly don't care about it at all. The phone looks and works perfectly fine, definitely a thumbs up."
3097,The phone is great I’m in love with it it’s a big step up from the 6 but I didn’t notice until yesterday it did have some scratches on it like three on the outer of the phone other than that this phone is great and you should definitely consider it and it did come fast 😍
3098,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE IS IN LOVE WITH IT, NO ISSUES AND PHONE WAS BASICLY BRAND NEW.. EVEN CAME WITH A CASE"
3099,She looks really good.  I have not hooked her up yet but everything seems to look good.  Thank you
3100,I’m so pleased with my purchase of this phone I’m amazed at the quality it looks brand new there’s no scratches and the battery health is 92% I’m pleased and I’ll recommend buying from this seller. Once again I’m extremely pleased
3101,So happy with this phone. It looks and functions like a brand new phone. I use straight talk and it worked immediately no problems.
3102,"Just received item. Perfect condition with no scratches- the battery is at 100% capacity- Checked IMEI to see if stolen. Shows up clean.- This phone is beautiful and works flawlessly. I'm coming from a iphone 6s which I lost. I've tried android twice now (htc desire, and galaxy s7 edge) and they both have so many bugs I'm extremely happy to be back in the iOS environment."
3103,"This phone met my expectations.  It was in good condition and works as new.  I previously had an Iphone 8 Plus, and I did prefer it's larger size.  I think this phone has an excellent battery life."
3104,The phone is great I recommend it and I am going to buy another one for my mom. It is easy to get used to there’s no problems just that you might need a case since it has glass on the back. The charger is not original but I have others laying around. It also came with a glass screen protector which was really handy.
3105,I could not get it to charge
3106,"The product came well packed  with barely visible scratches. The battery life was %98 which isn’t bad at all, FaceTime and Face ID  work perfectly fine. The left bottom speaker doesn’t work as well as the right bottom speaker but overall, it was worth the money."
3107,"I bought a renewed iPhone from amazon 5 months ago. It was in very good condition, almost new. 5 months later, it is still working just as it should be. 0 problem. For $150 less than a new from apple, this is a very good deal !"
3108,There was a small nick on the camera edging but otherwise it seems to work like it should
3109,"So far, so good"
3110,works great have had it for a while now never cracked or had any problems with this phone i love it
3111,Love the phone. Only thing that sucks is it’s locked to T-Mobile even though I expected an iPhone that is unlocked to all carriers.
3112,Keeps asking for apps or devices I'm not looking for and can't get it to stop.
3113,"The phone was obviously used. The edges were a little scraped up and there was a lot of gunk in the speaker next to the front camera. None of this was bad enough to make me want to get rid of it. What made me return the phone was the fact that the front camera quality was terrible. The 1st pic is the Amazon phone front camera. The 2nd pic is the Apple store front camera. I mainly bought this phone FOR the cameras (I feel like most people do.) While the back camera was fine, the front one was a deal breaker. I considered asking for another phone from the company, but for $150 more I would have rather purchased a brand new iPhone and save myself the worry. I originally thought I’d be saving some money, but it wasn’t worth it in the end."
3114,no complaints not a dent or scratch my xr looks brand new for real !!! so so glad  I order !
3115,my phone dies quickly but other than that it’s so worth it!
3116,"I like that it came a day early, and it did meet I phone expectations ."
3117,"The iPhone XR is a good phone with great features. I use one for work and My kids have them. If you can’t afford the latest and greatest, this is a good choice."
3118,I love the phone the screen has a few scratches. Super fast shipping
3119,very easy to use.
3120,I purchased the Apple iPhone XR from Amazon because of the price and reliability of the refurbish products.  My son enjoys his birthday gift that instantly operated with the Verizon service.  Am looking to upgrade my old android to one of the Apple iPhones on this site.
3121,Everything was fine
3122,"Phone was unable to use any U.S. carrier. Tried everyone even the smaller month to month plans, and none of them would take the iphone."
3123,"Looks brand new and works well. Was hesitant to purchase, but I didn’t regret I did."
3124,This phone is amazing it exceeded my expectations and I would buy from Amazon again thanks Amazon
3125,As described
3126,I returned it and reorder a different one
3127,"I am a college kid, so buying a phone is a huge purchase for me. I did a lot of research about buying a refurbished phone from amazon, and this seemed like the best one because of the reviews ( the only complaint in the reviews was there was not air pods included with the phone). I got the phone and tried setting it up for two days: the phone kept disconnecting from the internet and restarting anytime I tried doing anything on the phone. When I finally got it customized with my personal settings, the phone would not even perform basic phone functions (calling, texting, opening ANY apps including Safari). This phone is supposed to be completely refurbished so I knew there would be SOME problems, but not like this. Tried contacting the company twice during the setup process, and another time when the phone stopped working completely, but no response from the company. Returning the phone and expecting a full refund because now the phone won't even turn on (so I cannot disconnect my watch from it or delete my personal settings from it). DO NOT BUY, unless you are buying for parts."
3128,Like
3129,"The phone itself is great. Works perfectly and is in great condition. The generic charger that came with it did not work at all, so I had to go out and buy a new one. Overall, I am very satisfied with phone just disappointed with the charger."
3130,Battery is a 90%. Some times Airdrop doesn't work.
3131,Love it.  My 1st iPhone!  It was a refurbished phone and came in mint condition.  So much better than the Samsung Galaxy phones I always got before!  The picture quality alone by far is better than the Samsung.  They are definitely different to operate but not to bad.  Glad I switched to iPhone!!!
3132,"The phone came in mint condition. You'd never know it was refurbished. The battery life is 94%, which isn't bad since it's 2 years old. It's worked great for 2 months now. I really like it!"
3133,"El telefono esta impecable, me asuste un poco al recibirlo ya que el paquete estaba abierto y el repartidor de DHL dijo que estaba así, grave la caja cuando la recibí y luego al abrirla, por suerte el telefono estaba intacto."
3134,Has been working excellent
3135,"This iPhone XR looked like a brand new phone, no scratches or anything. Battery is at 95% life capacity. I would definitely buy from this seller again. It doesn’t come with headphones and the charger is aftermarket but it tells you that in description. Excellent phone:)"
3136,"I bought this ""refreshed"" and was a little worried about issues. But there were none! It is in perfect condition, and everything works. Glad I didn't pay full retail for it. Big jump for me from a 5c, and I'm loving all the features. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase an Amazon ""refreshed"" phone again."
3137,Me encanta esta como nuevo
3138,Had a small scratch on the screen other than that it’s perfect my husband loves it phone came days early the seller communication is great as well
3139,I tried to connect it to a different company but in the end it all worked out. Was already connected to sprint only so not fully unlocked.
3140,"It’s been a year I am using this phone, so far so good. Didn’t have any issue to report. I’m satisfied on this purchase."
3141,Good phone just like they said it would be works like new and looks new
3142,"This product was very satisfying. I wasn’t expecting such a nice refurbished product. At first I was hesitant to buying, but I have never been more pleased! Highly recommend."
3143,"Camera isn’t as good as I expected but the phone works great. It has a good battery life, good sound quality, and it’s sleek."
3144,Item is in great physical condition. Was hoping the battery health would have been at least 90% but it’s not a big issue for me. Great service!
3145,"The phone came in excellent shape. I could not find a single scratch or dent on the phone. The phone so received was identical to a brand new one.I have been using it for 6+ months now, absolutely no issues!I have bought quite a few things from the Amazon renewed program and have never been disappointed."
3146,"Got my product earlier than expected, came with everything described and looks like new conditioned. I’m not much of a picture guy but the camera seems well detailed. Haven’t had it long enough to accurately state how the battery life is but it seems to be near 95% capacity so no complaints"
3147,"I got my brand new iPhone XR blue 128 gb phone during quarantine, and it is in perfect condition with 100% battery life. I bought mine from BUYSPRY and I would recommend you to purchase from there as well. Camera quality is great and I love the phone. Every works well."
3148,I got the iphoe xr from electro wireless. The phone works perfectly but the screen has alot of scratches when I applied the screen protector it made bubbles.
3149,"The phone came the very next day, in perfect working condition. Just took a while to use because of all the updates!"
3150,"good phone ,  very clean ,  looks like new ,  battery  health 100%"

3154,Had for about 3 month still good was in perfect shape my SIM card worked I couldn’t be happier was a good buy better then store
3155,This phone was great but the reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the battery life was not good and the came was a bit blurry but everything else was in good condition.
3156,Good
3157,                    The media could not be loaded.                 This iPhone XR it's So good  even though it's not brand new it looks brand new don't listen to them negative comments I give this a 5-star if I could I would give it a million stars
3158,"I love this phone! Absolutely not a scam. I wanted to spend the least amount of money and still get a good quality Xr so I was a bit worried about the quality of this one because it was the cheapest one. But it is great no problems at all. No scratches, dents or anything and works like new."
3159,The phone came unscratched screen works perfectly the face id works.. this phone is flawless definitely a steal! Even came with a free phone case🙂 DEFINITELY A PURCHASE I WOULD MAKE AGAIN
3160,Beautiful phone for a great price. How can anyone complain? This was purchased to help keep my son safe at school. He has experienced the worst form of bullying and still stands firm. Thanks Amazon Renewed!
3161,"La pantalla esta defectuosa tiene un par de marcas o rayas blancas, que espero no continúenles agrandándoselos"
3162,this phone is great! i had doubts but took a risk.
3163,The screen was in good quality the battery life was about 87% and the face recognition worked
3164,"I was super nervous buying a phone off Amazon, but this phone works great. There’s little marks that are hardly notice able, personally doesn’t bother me. Very pleased"
3165,It was in excellent condition there wasn’t one scratch on it. It was fully unlocked just as described and had a charger cord and connector. I love the picture quality and this is the best battery life I’ve ever had in my life lasts about 11 hours and I’m a very active user. My phone is never not in my hand. But no it doesn’t come with headphones. But it’s excellent.
3166,I just received the phone today and it had no blemishes and works perfectly so far. overall a great buy.
3167,the battery was not fully charged and battery life is not great. but other that that great phone!
3168,"My granddaughter loved it, looked like  new & works perfectly. Price was a lot better than a new one."
3169,Had to replace teen's phone and didn't want to extend carrier contract. Ordered the XR and he has not had any problems with it. Came in great condition!
3170,"i’m so glad i finally got to get an iphone and one that’s refurbished and great! it has amazing speed and an amazing camera, i love iti had just switched from my old android bc of the problems and i love my upgrade"
3171,Good product
3172,"The phone looks and works great!  The shipping time was very fast, it only took one day, that’s great!"
3173,The color of this phone is just beautiful! I bought this a couple of months ago and the quality  of this phone is top notch! Great buy..
3174,"My daughter's love their phone's, like new condition, no scratches,  it was unlocked & had no problem getting their sim and their internet.  They quickly airdropped their info from their old phones.2 thumbs up🖒🖒5 stars ☆☆☆☆☆Thank you!"
3175,"I paid for a ""Premiun"" product and it arrived with the screen full of stripes. Be careful with that"
3176,The phone as a whole the shipping packaging was great!!! I was definitely skeptical at first but I love my phone no scratches no cracked screen
3177,I am able to trade in for a new phone.  Phone has an old battery that does not hold a charge.  I do not think I will ever buy a used phone.
3178,Phone quality
3179,My daughter has only had it for a few days but she seems to like it. No complaints from her as of yet.
3180,The fact it's completely unlocked and functional is fantastic. Always been skeptical of buy pre owned but im glad I stuck to it.Battery life isnt as good as i thought it would be but its good enough to last a decent length.
3181,Received 4 days early.  Phone looks brand new. Original charger was nkt included but that isn't a concern for us. Completely unlocked and my son was able to transfer everything over and switch sims card and start using it right away.
3182,I bought this iPhone in hopes of getting better reception. My daughter lives in country and reception out here is off and on. I am separated from my husband due to the covid crisis. Now I can call him no problem and FaceTime! Phone works great!!!!!! We are buying him as well!
3183,I love this phone. I know it's not new but it feels brand new. Mine had zero scratches and zero dents. The screen was in perfect condition. I would recommend this. I was a little scared because of some comments that I saw but it's worth buying it.
3184,The product met all my expectations in every area. Could not ask for a better product
3185,Phone arrived early and the packaging it was in was securifor the phone.The phone looks and performs amazingly. Seller is quick deliver and sells quality product. Bravo sir.
3186,Came in 7 days everything hooked up fast no scratches or dents at all. And I was able to connect it to metropcs 5/5 recommend
3187,Received the phone and it looked great. The red color is beautiful. Unfortunately the disappointment came when turning it over. Screen looked great except that there was a big scratch. At first we thought it was on the surface of the screen protector. So we removed it to replace it with another one and that is when we realized the scratch and more where on the actual screen. For claiming to be renewed and for the price it is a disappointment. I would return it but it was a gift for my daughter and she fell in love with the color and she does not want to be without it. Lesson learned. Do not buy phones at Amazon.
3188,"This was supposed to come in the 16th, but it came in the 9th. I ordered it on the 7th. Insane fir the shipping! But this phone is one of the best bang for the buck iPhones right now and I love it! All good here"
3189,"I was a pretty cautious buying this product on Amazon, but it is absolutely amazing. The battery lasts incredibly long and the maximum capacity is at 99%. Beautiful display. Takes gorgeous pictures. It also came a day early! I absolutely recommend buying this product. Came with a charger cable and everything."
3190,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I purchased this phone last year 2021 October 18 for my Eight year old son’s birthday, he had been begging for iPhone thought it was a great deal less than a month ago the phone just stop working and it only shows the Apple  it doesn’t come on anymore as you can see the phone is not damaged  or broken he no longer has a phone due to this inconvenience I wouldn’t recommend anybody to purchase a phone that is referred from Amazon because you cannot get a refund or you cannot exchange for another phone if something happens to the phone I didn’t get the insurance because I have purchase phones previously and never had this problem until now very unsatisfied"
3191,"Phone came in okay condition the body of the phone looked brand new. The front and back glass had minor scratches but are very visible. Battery health came at 93%. Please don’t buy this phone with the expectation of being brand new. You’re basically just taking a chance. Overall, it’s a okay  phone not a great one."
3192,The phone had blown speakers leading to terrible sound. Also battery couldn’t hold a charge. Fully charged would go to 40% after 3-4 hrs with out being used.
3193,This phone works amazing! The only problem was the camera was a little scuffed up on the outside but the camera itself works amazing! Ten outta ten from me!
3194,"Thank you, this one item came ok!Best regardsCarlos"
3195,"Total worth it! Little apprehensive about buying a “renewed” item, however it was perfect. Exactly as described and I liked the ability to add extra protection."
3196,"This is not a scam! I was skeptical at first, but this was the best purchase I’ve made! The battery health is at 95%, no cracks or scuffs, and looks brand new! My seller was Chubbiestech. Make sure to choose your seller wisely!"
3197,So the phone does work somewhat and it looks good but the fact that the front camera doesn’t work and that the flashlight also doesn’t work is unacceptable since it says that this phone was checked professionally. There could’ve at least been a note saying these functions don’t work. I can’t return the phone because my other one is so beat up and I need a phone for work and all that good stuff. I would never recommend anyone to buy a phone off here. They don’t check to make sure these products work at 100%
3198,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Muy bonito y funciona muy bien, se ve casi nuevo. A mi hija le encantó."
3199,Buena compra
3200,"Me encantó el celular que compré, el modelo y color que quería!!!"
3201,When I got the Device it was outstanding. Camera quality is perfect for filming and taking portraits. I love the phone in all.
3202,"So far so good love the battery life, the only issue right now is that there was a software update along with me having my hearing aids updated. The problem right now is that I’m only able to link only one hearing aide and not both right now, waiting for the next update to make determination"
3203,Umm I ordered black they sent me blue the phone itself is like new cosmetically But battery life is 85% so I bought a Apple Smart Battery Case
3204,Perfect
3205,"Great phone. Love everything about it, particularly the camera. Battery life could be better."
3206,"Great purchase! Runs just like new, no scratches or marks!"
3207,Awesome phone!! Don’t believe it when they say this is a scam.. my phone came to me in perfect shape!! Took it to Verizon and it was unlocked as advertised... best iPhone I done had so far..
3208,"It’s an iPhone XR, and that’s all I gotta say. Nothing out of the ordinary, works just fine"
3209,"It was actually good with no scratches or anything, although the charger it came with stopped working in two days but everything else works"
3210,"I can’t lie I thought since I couldn’t use my own SIM card , I almost thought they played me ! I had to get another sim Card and go to another company ! But other then that I’m very happy with my purchase ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
3211,"Worked fine for 5 months, just enough to get past the 90 day return window for Amazon Renewed items. Now it is a brick. Charged all night, worked first thing in the morning, next time i picked it up (still plugged in) couldn't get it to power on/off, Force reboot, recharge or anything...Brought it to a local repair shop to test screen and battery. They said when they put a new battery in it it got so hot the tech couldn't touch it!Now it's even too far gone to salvage any data onto a new phone."
3212,VERY happy with this phone and glad it came unlocked. My husband has the same phone from AT&T and was a nightmare to get it unlocked to change carriers.
3213,"Only my right speaker works, but you get what you pay for I guess. Everything else is fine."
3214,"The phone works great, but I was expecting it to be in a little better shape when I received it. The back of the phone has some dents and scratches the screen has something on it can’t really tell. I would purchase this item again just not from electronic deals though."
3215,"The phone works great!! Touchscreen, battery life, and the screen quality are all perfect!! It’s hard to believe it’s a used phone. Thank you!!"
3216,"It’s great, this is my first iPhone. Great phone. Battery health at 90% but it last me all day. The camera is great and Face ID is super fast. Thanks so much."
3217,"Came with a few scratches, but nothing really noticeable or that affects the quality of the phone."
3218,Exactly like the picture
3219,I was nervous but it’s a great phone works good*Edited June 2022*I got a newer phone but still have this one! It’s now my sons and still works great!
3220,"I’ve had phones with better battery life but the phone itself was worth it. Overall, even if it was a refurbished, it is an excellent phone for the price tag."
3221,It came out the box perfectly and works perfectly fine ass well
3222,This phone is amazing! As an iPhone user since I was 17! This phone rocks and as it may take some getting used to not having a home button it really didn’t take as long as I thought it would and it takes really good quality pictures! Absolutely love it
3223,"The phone itself was fine, I just ordered the wrong one for my husband. Returned this phone days ago and still waiting for my refund."
3224,"very good phone!!! it came very early. it was protected in the box and came with a charger and plastic sheet over it. It has a couple of scuffs on the top but it doesn't matter because I will always  have a case over it, and its not really visible ."
3225,this is just what i was wanting. i am very happy . the cell phone is nice looking. i dont see anything wrong with it. thanks so much. was in my price range also
3226,Package came early and great condition
3227,Phone came in perfect condition and completely UNLOCKED!I am very satisfied with my purchase and I will definitely buy from them again in the future
3228,"Very pleased with this purchase and seller’s speed in getting it to me. Everything works , no marks of any kind."
3229,This product came in with no scratches or any problems. It works very well and will suffice as your cellular device for a long time. Memory is great and as well as the camera.
3230,So at first I was a little skeptical about buying this but it’s worth it. Doesn’t glitch and came in perfect condition. Little scratches but not even noticeable but also it’s a refurbished phone so don’t expect perfection! Totally would recommend to others. Also you’re gonna have to get your own headphones which isn’t that bad.
3231,This phone was for my son for christmas. The screen started acting up and went out very quickly. Now i have to spend more money smh
3232,Day one. So far so good. Phone is in absolute perfect condition no signs of use at all. Battery health is at 100%. Can’t go wrong with this seller. They were available to answer any and all questions before purchase.Update. One week after purchase. Super happy with purchase. Glad I went ahead regardless of any negative reviews seen here
3233,"Do far great! My son loves it, cane with a case and screen protector too! Can't beat that for the price.  =)"
3234,Phone functions 100%In great conditionWould purchase from seller again
3235,Very happy with this phone. Got it as a Christmas present for my son. Worked and looked great! All I had to do was put a SIM card in it.
3236,It’s pretty much what I expected but the top speaker is muffled and the bottom is scratched and battery health  85% other than that I would recommend it
3237,At first I was skeptical about purchasing this but I needed an upgrade from an IPhone 6 and I can tell you this phone is it. There were no visible scratches and it came the day before the estimated delivery date. I can say I’m very please with this order.
3238,My son liked his Iphone XR.. This is the only phone he will get.  So thank you.
3239,"Going to buy another for my sister. This is a great product, especially for half the price. Came with a charger and screen protector, whole it didn't include earpods that's stated in the product description. Had very minor scratches and scuffs 4 at most. Got a sim card and it had service within 15 minutes."
3240,"This iPhone is as good as new, no scratch or anything like that. And the camera is awesome."
3241,"I got this for my teen daughter, went with Used to save  money.  This phone is in perfect condition, like new."
3242,Good
3243,Phone works great and looks great. My wife loves it. I gave 4 stars because it was very expensive.
3244,Although this is a used phone ours arrived with no scratches or marks. The battery life is at about 80%. Did not come with headphones but it did come with a generic charger.
3245,Nothing
3246,not a scam really legit I would most definitely buy again.. I was indecisive because of the comments but my phone literally came in the box looking brand new I’m not kidding..  the only thing is the generic charger but it still works.. this phone is compatible with my straight talk SIM card.
3247,I was surprised by the quality.  Seemed completely new. There’s only been one other time when I got a great used iPhone.  It’s perfect.  Thank you guys.
3248,I LOVE my phone!!! It was worth the price! I have had no problems with my phone or my service and I absolutely love it! I was able to turn my service on which is straight talk with no issues
3249,The flashlight/camera light didn’t work.
3250,Outstanding. Looks great. A dirty but it all wiped off  and works great toooo
3251,Just got the phone the volume seem to be lower than my other iPhone and I haven’t had the phone long enough to comment or rate battery life.
3252,"I was skeptical because of the negative comments but my phone works & looks like I got it from the Apple store lol !!!! Everything on the phone works great, no scratches what so ever . I recommend this to anyone who wants to buy . 10/10 😍😍"
3253,"Excellent phone, functions just like new and was very easy to set up with my cell phone company. Battery life is just like new. Screen was perfect with no flaws."
3254,I love everything about it. I can finally go hours and hours without charging my phone
3255,Awesome came with scratches on the back glass but it is a refurbished phone I’ve had it for almost a year and it’s still amazing !!
3256,"Great phone, perfect condition, great battery life, very happy"
3257,I love my phone!🤗😊 it wont go silent when i click the orange switch for some odd reason but nonetheless i love it
3258,This product was better than expected. It also came with a case and screen protector. It was honestly the best deal for the price. Thank you Amazon.!
3259,This phone is absolutely gorgeous please don’t listen to no negative comments ! It only took a week to come came with a charger no headphones tho
3260,"Great phone my 9yo loves it, a couple dings on the outer edge but screen was flawless, it's in a case as well, will update if any issues."
3261,It works awesome! nothing wrong with it and it took my service plan. definitely 100% unlocked!
3262,The battery is at 90 but everything else it great.
3263,My niece love her new phone no problems at all what so ever..happy camper..😁
3264,"My son is very happy with this phone, and I always want to say that Amazon done amazing job on delivery, very fast and professional..I would definitely recommend this phone for any phone from Amazon"
3265,Touch screen is great and same for screen quality. Battery life is good when I got it battery life was at 93% so not bad for used phone.
3266,El teléfono llego sin detalles la pantalla se veía perfecto. Sólo que parece que vino la batería fallada porque se drenaba rapidísimo no llegaba a dar ni 4 horas de pantalla encendida. Lo terminé devolviendo por ese tema pero por lo demás es muy buen equipo
3267,By far have no problems everything is running smoothly and I love the phone and was very scared to waste my money but it turned out great
3268,"I just received this product and I didn't know that amazon ships it with a screen protector and a nice case. So, don't waste money on the 'frequently bought together'. This is great."
3269,"We recently went to our carrier (metro/T-Mobile) to activate the phone . Once we got home I tried started downloading my normal apps and tried to access them and was unable to unless the phone was connected to WIFI. I took it back to the phone store where they informed me it was locked onto a Sprint carrier . We tried going through the settings, factory reset, taking them off the towers and putting them back on and replacing a SIM card. All which went unsuccessful. I am very upset that this phone was sold under false pretenses of being an unlocked phone!"
3270,I liked that the item was as promised. Actually I could not tell the difference between this product and a brand new one.
3271,Works great. Got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She had an iPhone 6s Plus and this was a great upgrade. Super happy with the price too!
3272,This phone looks like a brand new phone.  They even sent a cover that my wife liked for free.  Will buy from them again.
3273,"The phone was delivered faster than stated. Looked very nice, tiny mark near the charging port, barely noticeable. Did not come in the original box or with the original charger."
3274,Overall an upgrade from a prior iPhone 7. So far this product has done a great job after a month of use. Long term usage has not been determined but expecting nothing less than quality from Apple.
3275,Phone claimed to say it was unlocked and that was false. Now I have to go through the AppleStore to unlock it and then find a provider. Not cool at all.
3276,Battery life is good the touch screen is great and the camera quality is fine
3277,"Fast Speed, Battery Life 92% (Amazing). I absolutely love my new birthday phone 📱 and it came with a protective screen saver. THANKS 😊"
3278,This came with a small scratch on the screen. The weight is a little heavier then I would like but the battery life is great.
3279,"Iphone came in like new nothing wrong with it from what I could see and playing games and making phone calls and so on nothing to complain about, really nice"
3280,Of course it's a good product! Prompt delivery. Fast response from the vendorto inquiry to resolve an issue.Reasonable price.
3281,"I think it's a great phone but the one I got  had a problem in that the screen freezes and the phone won't do anything. I sent it back, regretfully, a week avo , but haven't seen my refund as yet. I'd love to get one that works all the time."
3282,"I was really hesitant when buying this phone. Then I got it and it was in mint condition. Battery life at 100% max health, screen protector on it, no scratches, nothing, just like you’d buy at the store. I would recommend you buy this product because it’s affordable and definitely  worth the money"
3283,"I was a bit scriptural at first because I had never bought an IPhone from this person at SUCH a low price but THIS IS AMAZING, I have bought two already, it’s worth the money guys trust me."
3284,I was Skeptical after reading some reviews BUT I must say I’m so thrilled with my purchase it was in mint condition everything worked flawlessly and the battery life it’s still really good I charged it once and didn’t need to charge it all day long and half the next day. Very good company would highly recommend.
3285,El teléfono llegó a tiempo y sin maltrato físico pero él Bluetooth presenta problemas
3286,"I love my new IPhone XR. It came in perfect condition, no scratches, no dents or damages. Everything works perfectly fine. I was scared to make this purchase, but it was worth. I absolutely love my new iPhone XR🥰😍💜...oh and it came way before it was estimated to come👍🏾"
3287,Very pleased with the purchase I made.  My wife broke her android and I needed a good replacement for Verizon.  Everything has been perfect!
3288,Love my phone I switched from Samsung you IPhone. Great transitional phone. With the swipe action I feel like I’m still using android but with IPhone functionality. Phone came in new condition. No damage. I even updated the system. It was easy to connect to MetroPCS. Love it!
3289,The phone is in very good shape. Will order again
3290,"15 yr old daughter bought it. She did her own research, read the reviews, and handed me the money she saved from babysitting to pay for it. She’s completely happy with it."
3291,The phone works great. It looks almost new.
3292,Battery life good for my daily use touch screen working very fast screen quality look very good like new the sipping was very fast to Puerto Rico
3293,I had to replace a phone that broke it was a great price and perfect for me
3294,It came quite quickly I didn't have to wait a month like usual it took about a week it works like brand new. I bought it for my 17 yr old and if something was wrong he would definitely let me know
3295,Haven't had any issues with the phone. Wanted something for back up and ive actually used it for my main cell phone because its working great!
3296,"Good packaging. The phone came with few small scratches on screen and near rear camera. Nothing major. Price was high, but since I’m living out of US this was the only option to pay less"
3297,"I was pretty scared to buy an iphone off of amazon, ebay, those kind of sites. But after opening and starting my phone. I love it and it feels brand new. I got a new phone so the camera quality was better, faster and just to upgrade and this phone did exactly that!"
3298,"Great phone! Works perfectly! All I had to do was switch my SIM card. Screen had no scratches, or marks. Only problem is battery takes a while to charge. But overall, is definitely worth purchasing!"
3299,Excellent quality and prompt shipping
3300,The second day dropped it (small drop) completely shatters missing pieces of glass and screen doesn’t work it was ghosting.  I had to go spend almost $200 to get it fixed.  I suggest you Should spend a little extra money to putting in a better screen instead of putting a cheap junky one on and reselling it.
3301,"This phone came brand as new . Great camera and very nice features however my other speaker is not working, but other than that great phone."
3302,"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I love this iPhone, it looks new! Very satisfied with this purchase! 👍👍👍"
3303,This was a great purchase. The battery life is the best thing about this phone.
3304,"Came in very quickly. Great quality. No scratches, got everything switched over from my other phone with no problems. The Verizon box made me nervous because I bought an unlocked phone, maybe the seller can look into a plain box with no names on it for unlocked phone customers."
3305,It’s not perfect but it’s perfect! cause it came with about 3 scratches that I didn’t even notice. My brother pointed it out. That’s literally the only issue. Besides that it’s just like a brand new phone. I fell so in love with the camera quality. It’s perfect for me.
3306,LOVE THE QUALITY OF THE PHONE
3307,Was really stressed about the reviews and the negative reviews and it’s really not that at all. It’s an good phone and unlocked.
3308,"I decided to purchase two of these phones as gifts and I was very impressed. I could not believe these phones were used, they had no scratches and were in immaculate condition."
3309,My wife loves this new phone. Considering it’s renewed there were very few noticeable issues. I examined it very closely and could only find a couple smudges on the screen. None of which my wife has even seen. The battery capacity was at 98% out of the box. To me it is basically a new phone.
3310,"The phone arrived before he expected delivery date.  The phone was pristine!  No scratches on the screen, or the case.  It was exactly how it was described.  No lies, just the truth.  I have already recommended this vendor to friends."
3311,The phone was in great shape
3312,Ever thing works great .
3313,Upgraded from an iPhone 6s so the difference was there. The iPhone does everything i need it to and it has a long lasting battery life.
3314,"The phone works perfectly, my complaint is that it didn’t come with the headphones and the charger is not the an original for iPhones"
3315,"This phone came used and I could not believe how new it looked. It’s an upgrade from the iPhone 7 I had. Way bigger and clearer screen. The phone even came with a protective case, guess I got lucky. I would recommend buying from here. It’s a good price and was activated quickly."
3316,"Looks spanking new, only thing is when I checked my battery health it was significantly at 85% it’s not at full health"
3317,The iPhone XR came in quickly and in great condition. I honestly couldn't even tell it was refurbished. We have not had any issues as of today and have been using the phone for 5 days. I would definitely recommend this product.
3318,"Battery is 96%, all signs of wear were very small & cosmetic (no screen issues), worked with my carrier, and really feels like a new phone! I am very pleased. I had doubts but needed to upgrade phones and loved the greener cheaper option of refurbished. Mine even came with screen protector on it."
3319,I bought this for my bf and he said everything is working great
3320,"I’m so pleased with my purchase, phone works great , looks brand new , no visible wear or tear,I will purchase from them again....."
3321,"This iPhone XR is amazing. I bought it for my teen and she can't stop raving. When I get ready for my updated iPhone, I'm coming here!"
3322,Good condition
3323,"I did not regret a penny buying this thing. its literally good as new. if you wanna buy an xr, i highly prefer you buy this one."
3324,Would not recommend.
3325,I expected my package to come between Friday and Tuesday of next week but it came almost a whole week early. The quality is amazing and new. Everything is perfect and comes with a great charger. 10/10 would buy again!
3326,I bought this phone for my daughter and it works great.  Looks brand new!  No scratches and very clear screen.  I definitely recommend this phone.
3327,I bought this phone solely for the camera quality. I have been more than impressed by the smooth functions and the long battery life. I was a little skeptical purchasing it off Amazon but I’m happy that I did arrive fast as well
3328,Very pleased with the new phone!
3329,"Bought this phone from my daughter, battery life is great seeing how they're on their phones 24 hours A-day"
3330,I was disappointed that the headphones and/or headphone adapter weren’t included. Otherwise it is perfect.
3331,OMG!! I love this phone! It looks brand new and it WAS unlocked!!All I had to do is add me SIM card from my old phone to transfer service! This was worth every penny!
3332,"Very happy with this purchase . Checked the battery health and it shows 💯 % max capacity.Like brand new, no scratchesPerfect for my teenage boy."
3333,At first I was hesitant but I have absolutely no issues with the phone. The battery life was not at 100% but at a very good percentage.
3334,"I've had it for two weeks and so far, so good. Arrived in good conditions, battery works fine, charger was OK, didn't look refurbished at all, unlocked and fitted my international phone SIM card perfectly."
3335,Good
3336,No complaints so far. I bought it for my own use.
3337,Not worth the money and not correctly refurbished. When received the phone it had glitches at the bottom of the screen and now the whole phone is almost glitched out barely a month later!
3338,Excellent phone and in perfect condition and I have purchased multiple iPhones but I cannot believe the savings and quality of this phone which far exceeds all the pros vs cons
3339,"My iPhone XR came in PERFECT condition, I bought it in late March, and right now it’s early June. I haven’t had any issues with the phone at ALL. I was very hesitant to buy this product due to the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised!!"
3340,"I was skeptical about buying a phone online, especially with having it shipped. I’ve had it for a few months now with no problems at all! No scratches, cracks, etc. Not only does it look like a brand new phone, but it works like one as well!"
3341,Product functions as predicted. The speakers are completely useless.
3342,phone has no scratches cut or anything and the face recognition works but i have to lock and unlock the phone to get the phone screen to respond at least like 10 times a day.
3343,Excellent phone for an excellent price. Battery is so so but holds a charge longer than my old iPhone
3344,I love how fast I received my phone. I love the camera and the screen quality.
3345,Such a great price for a iPhone my only problem was the camera is a little dinged up but that’s to be expected with a used phone so all in all very happy with my purchase
3346,I love I finally got an apple phone!!  Phone came in excellent condition with the exception of a couple very small scratches on the screen.  Great price!!!  Great value!!
3347,I dont know about the other comments but this is a great phone so far. ALL GOOD!!!!!
3348,They are trustworthy. They price is good as you should think. I like what I got I will buy again soon.
3349,The phone arrived a day early and was in perfect condition. There is not a mark on it and it had a new battery in it. My charger was a Apple charger. I love my phone.
3350,My phone arrived much quicker than I expected and was in excellent condition and exactly as the description stated.
3351,I recommend this phone. It battery health is 100percent. I compared with the non refurbished I couldn’t tell the difference. If u know how why ur checking this phone I will tell u this the best option
3352,Phone that I received came with 100% battery life. The phone also came with noticeable dents to the aluminum housing. I am relieved to say that the phone was free from scratches on screen and camera. Generally a good phone but not labled correctly since it had noticeable wear to the phone’s housing.P.S. Ran into difficultly while activating the phone took like 2 HOURS to activate. It was the phones fault since I checked everything on my end.
3353,I was a bit skeptical at first but I took the risky of buy a blue iPhone XR. I am very happy....It came like a brand new phone. I was very impressed. I will definitely be buying from this seller again. 😃 👍
3354,"Don’t listen to the bad reviews for real y’all,I got mine in perfect condition with a charger and a charge box.I was a little disappointed that it didn’t come with headphones,but definitely worth buying from this seller !"
3355,Not a single scratch. Nothing is wrong with it. I upgraded from the 8plus to the XR. Not regretting it at all.
3356,Bought this for my 17 year old son to replace his first gen iphone se. He absolutely loves his new phone. No issues so far.
3357,"It works perfectly and even though it said renewed it came like it was brand new, there were no scratches and it was perfect."
3358,GUYS DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS THIS PHONE IS AMAZING IT CAME WITH NO SCRATCHES OR ANYTHING I LOVE IT
3359,"Love my new phone so far. No dings, or flaws. You would never know it’s refurbished. I had a few hang ups at first. My mobile carrier was able to get things fixed for me over the phone. Didn’t even have to leave my house. Metro by T-Mobile. Thanks!"
3360,2 weeks and has worked greatly
3361,"bought the phone for my daughter for Christmas. Phone worked great for 3 months, then started glitching. now, you cant even use it most of the time. Contacted seller to see if they could replace it but only 90 day warranty is offered. i will never buy another refurbed phone through amazon or this seller. maybe you will spend $30 more through verizon/at&t but you will at least have a 1 year warranty. Spend the extra money. $346.40 is too expensive for a product that only lasted 3 months."
3362,"Fast shipping and great iPhone, minor scratches and the included a iPhone case with it. Kids is very happy with it."
3363,The phone is just like NEW!! I even have Apple care!!! Although the battery life is at 88% but I’m not a heavy phone user so I’m grateful🥰❤️!!
3364,WE HAVE PURCHASED FROM THIS SELLER BEFORE AND EVERY TIME HAS BEEN GREAT. GOOD EQUIPMENT!
3365,Came in like new condition.  Very Happy with the purchase.  Would recommend!!
3366,I needed a phone for my son. It was an upgrade for him and the price was within my budget. So far so good.
3367,"I absolutely love my new XR, so glad I purchased it. I got it in coral and sometimes I wish I got it in white but it’s okay. Now I say where’s Carl/ coral(TWD joke)."
3368,N/A
3369,"very happy with the phone I received.  Few minor slight scratches, but for the price I'm more than happy with live with it.  The scratches went away after applying a screen protector.Battery health was at 100% and the phone worked perfectly."
3370,"Just what my daughter wanted for her birthday ...i have to admit, it's a great phone"
3371,So far this phone exceeds expectations I had. Would never purchase a new one when you can buy a reconditioned phone at half price.
3372,100% recommend shipping took a little while because of the holidays but definitely recommend it looks new and I was able to put in my Verizon sim and it worked wonderfully.
3373,Phone came next day and looks and operates very well. Comes with non Apple charger like the ones you buy at a corner store. Would purchase this again
3374,"It’s great, no issues at all! No cracks, battery life was at 97%. Looks like it’s brand new! Shipped pretty fast too."
3375,"The face recognition is good, the battery life is good. Good phone for the price of it. Recommend getting it!"
3376,Battery life is on 96% I think all of them have 96% battery life.But other than a small scratch on the bottom looks brand new. Screen is without scratches. Looks awesome
3377,I was a bit skeptical but it works perfectly and I haven’t had any issues. It came exactly as promised in description!
3378,I ordered this phone I thought it was a scam but it’s not it works very fine and it came Bringnew I soon the phone came I put my crickets wireless sim in it and it works well I’m still using it and it came on time thanks for the product

3384,Very good
3385,"El teléfono físicamente no tenia problemas, el problema lo tenia al hacer la llamada que no podía escuchar casi a la persona. Doy tres estrellas por que a pesar de todo me devolvieron el dinero en su totalidad"
3386,The phone looks brand new and I couldn’t be happier with it. I was Paranoid about it because of the bad reviews. But it’s a MUST BUY!
3387,N/A
3388,I thought it was to good to be true but knock on wood everything is working perfectly absolutely love it! It also came with a screen protector and a charger which I thought was pretty cool and very helpful some of the negative ratings almost made me not get it but I’m glad I did
3389,"It was beautiful, I just returned it because I’m too damn old to not have the button to press, if I’m not refunded properly I’ll definitely adjust my rating."
3390,Around the camera it was dirty as cosmetic imperfections. Everything else works great so far.
3391,Great phone happy once I got it it was and great condition and works phenomenally thank you kiss/Amazon

3397,Quick shipping. Great condition IPhone XR for a fraction of the cost of new. And backed by Amazon for 90 days! Perfect!!
3398,"Phone arrived sooner than Expected nice surprise of course. Package was in Generic box however was protected in bubble wrap and fit the box, no big to me. Phone was in perfect working order right color no starches anywhere and completely unlocked. Very happy with my phone at a fraction of the cost."
3399,i upgraded from a iphone 6s plus 128gb to this phone 256gb i 100% recommended its brand new
3400,"I got my product almost 4 days then I was expecting which was awesome!  The product was also in perfect condition, looks brand new and was unlocked as promised. I was able to just stick my SIM card in the phone and it connected with no problem!"
3401,This iPhone was supposed to come unlocked/compatible with T-Mobile. After talking to T-Mobile the phone says SIM unsupported and I am unable to use it
3402,phone had wrong battery installed and a new screen installed. All of the insides were not working correctly....don't buy a renewed phone.....
3403,So far everything seems to be working great.  I can’t see any scratches or damage to the phone.  Battery life is 100%.  Once I set up the phone from a backup and put the SIM card in the worked just fine.  We have T-Mobile and it works fine.
3404,"i recived the iphone xr (white model) today,i was very estatic for the unveiling of my hard earned device....but there is one problem i cant swipe at all.yes the phone let me swipe,scroll..ect but about 1 hour before i was able to get in to do my settings for my phone(password ,haptic touch ,long touch ,face id apple ,id ,email) there is a set up process for the iphone xr and it says hello in many different languagesand i could not get the phones touch to respond at all so affter i had gotten past the first time of the phones touch (responce system) not working fo 30mins it happened again but this time i could not get in i could'ent even type my password in which i had 30mins to do so now im very dissapointed and wish for a refund but what i really want is a new white renewed/unlocked iphone xr.wish to see better days-davide.d :("
3405,The battery life is good face recognition is Great  and the screen quality is amazing I love this phone so far
3406,"Bought this phone for my bf, it looked good and works good. Had it since Christmas and still works good."
3407,Phone came perfect no scratches or nothing if you was thinking about buying this phone buy it
3408,"After seeing a lot of upset customers on here, I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone...I was wrong!!!  This phone looks brand new, not a scratch on it, works perfectly.  I have ZERO complaints!!!  If you’re on the fence, don’t be.  I received mine from Chubbies Tech and would not hesitate to buy one again.  This is my new way of buying phones instead of paying full price"
3409,Everything is okay except the fact that ringer is barely audible. Really annoying because I can miss calls frequently. Also when received there was scratches on the corners of phone.
3410,"I purchased this phone for my daughter and it came with no scratches or marks, however it did not come with headphones"
3411,Worked as designed
3412,The phone is good. It came with a charger and charger box (not the earbuds). The phone had no scratches or cracks. And the phone is fully unlocked
3413,"Got exactly what I ordered, great bargain. I would definitely buy another."
3414,"Great phone! No apparent problems at the moment, feels very smooth and I can say the transition from Android to iOS was pretty easy."
3415,"No complain ,"
3416,"Received my IPhone a few days ago and everything is working. There’s a barely noticeable scratch on the screen, but that is normal since it is refurbished. I was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews, but my phone is unlocked (checked with Apple) and I love it. My seller was 2019bestsale, it’s a little bit more expensive but worth it."
3417,"Looked like new without all the accessories, Battery was at 88% like advertised, Good deal of you don’t want to be in a contract"
3418,My XR phone arrived earlier than I expected.  The phone looks brand new and operates wonderfully.I am very happy with this purchase.
3419,"The battery dies faster than I expected, but it comes with a really nice charger and a screen protector already on the phone. Overall its a good phone."
3420,"Love the color, the phone is perfect with no scratch, it’s completely New ! 100% satisfied also for the prime delivery , always on time"
3421,This iPhone was like new and works just like a new phone.  It had no scratches and was in pristine condition.  I have activated this phone with my wireless carrier and it works fine.  Takes really good pictures.  It’s a cheaper option instead of buying a new one for double the price.
3422,"I was absolutely terrified to buy a phone off of amazon, especially one worth this much. I got it in the mail 4 days early which was amazing. I looked it over, and there was nothing wrong with it! Looks brand new, performs brand new. Such an amazing phone for a great price. Go for it!"
3423,I love how A good price I got this phone for it's just has a little scratch but that's what happens when you get refurbished Items but I'm complaining about the battery life I charged it to 100% and I only used it for 7 mins I thought I had a good buy but to check the battery percentage it dropped significantly at first I thought I was tripping it came to me at 50 percent and it died fast so I let it charge to 100 and as you can see the picture it dies fast I needed a replacement because my oldnphone broke just be careful if any of you guys going to buy it and this happens I never complained about anything or reviewed stuff but just be sure to look out for little things like that I contacted the seller I'm just waiting to see what he or she to respond
3424,"The phone works properly.  Thank you.  I was hoping to receive my text messages in realtime, but this purchase did not improve that function.  I guess realtime transmissions are not available these days.  That's very unfortunate."
3425,Great overall!! Pretty happy with it. I have Total Wireless and the switch from my Motorola was easy if you’re patient!
3426,This was the easiest phone setup ever. Transferred data from an old 6s using Bluetooth and put the sim card from the 6s in the XR and everything worked perfectly!
3427,"The first thing I noticed was the button configuration. The display on/off button is on the right side directly across from the vol ancd xme down button, as opposed to the other iphones being on top. So to get a good grip to switch the display on/off you can also press the volume down button then that takes a screen shot. You do have to be very aware of careful not to do this.This editor just deleted most of my review, so I will not repeat it, as a waste of my time."
3428,Great phone! Wonderful customer service.. they were prompt attention to our tiny issue..thank you!
3429,"Phone arrived as described in a timely manner. In fact, it came with extras like a case and screen protector."
3430,"This is a review of the seller (KISS Electronics), not the phone model.I purchased the ""fully unlocked"" model but Sprint told me that I couldn't use it on my account based on its IMEI (basically its serial number). Sprint didn't tell me the reason, but I suspect that the previous owner had unpaid bills with his or her carrier as that is a common issue. I reached out to the seller (KISS Electronics) to see if they were able to resolve this somehow, as the phone itself came to me in great shape (and even had a glass screen protector on it) (which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1). Instead, I got stock responses telling me how to return it. Thus, I'll be looking for a different vendor rather than trusting KISS again. Buyer beware."
3431,"The battery life is amazing, literally lasts all day. Comea with a charger. Beautiful color (red) and nice size. Love it!!!!"
3432,Camera facing is a little scratched and smalle amount of paint is missing but still runs fine and fast
3433,"Got the phone recently and at first I actually thought it was great. It seems to be in great hands and  looks brand new. Zero scratches and the battery life is also great however, after a week of buying it the speaker stopped working and it was completely unprovoked. I didn't drop it and do anything to it. When I started calling people they were not able to hear me. I did everything I could to solve the issue but nothing would work so I returned it. I hope I just got a bad phone because I still want the phone. Aside from that issue it is a great phone."
3434,"Overall i would eat the phone a 10/10 . no scratches, no dents, no problem whatsoever! I LOVE THIS BITCH"
3435,This is basically a new phone for less than what it’s priced at and I have no trouble with it!
3436,Great company that provide great phones they were able to fix the issue i had right away no questions  asked will buy from IT Hybrid again
3437,Like a brand new phone! Very very impressed and would definitely purchase again. The only blemishes I noticed were BARELY noticeable scratches on the screen which were only visible when tilted toward the light. I love the phone so far and had new issues with transferring from one to another. 100% unlocked. Love my new phone!
3438,"Love the phone, bought it for my daughters birthday, now I want one for myself. In perfect condition, I was a little afraid to buy because of the negative reviews, but was sold with the positive reviews. Glad I did buy it. Also the phone came sooner than expected."
3439,It serves it purpose.
3440,Was perfect - no scratches.  Went to Verizon got a SIM card all good.
3441,Phone was completely dead when I got it. Other than that I’m happy
3442,"Great phone they did a wonderful job with it, works great, don’t be afraid to buy."
3443,"Took a chance in ordering a refurbished phone online, and was blown away. The phone was in amazing condition, came with a glass protector, new super durable phone case, new phone charger, and instructions on how to set up. Would order again!"
3444,Cant beat the Apple quality
3445,"I was extremely skeptical about buying this phone but I am 100% satisfied with it. It works with my phone carrier, MetroPCS. It was a quick switch with MetroPCS’ customer service and the phone works perfectly. So far so good, I just got it 2 days ago. The phone looks brand new."
3446,"Luke a new, excellent"
3447,Bought refurbished iPhone XR. Touchscreen doesn’t not work most of the time. So you’re stuck on the same screen until phone decides it wants to work. First time purchasing refurbished from here and will be last time.
3448,"Very Happy with this purchase, good as new."
3449,No me agrado que no venia con audífonos.. pero todo lo demás está bien .. me gusto funciona muniendo ..
3450,"I bought this phone to replace my old iPhone 7 and it’s perfect. The front and rear cameras are great, and the sound quality is excellent. It came in clean and looking brand new. I’d recommend buying from this seller."
3451,Excellent phone. Was just like it was brand new. No issues at all so far. Amazon always has great renewed merchandise. They are the only ones that I will buy renewed products
3452,I wasn’t sure about spending this kind of money on something I didn’t think was legit until I read the reviews myself. And I Amazon itself has never gave me no bs so I felt like I made the right choice and I did. I totally recommend buying this phone from them to anybody! I’ve worked my ass off this and I’m so happy thank you so much to whom ever💙
3453,"When I bought the phone I was so excited to having the phone already in my hand, the shipping took about 3 days and when it got delivered the phone didn’t even turn on I tried every single way I even charged it for 1 hour but nothing happened guys don’t buy here Ik there’s a lot of good reviews but it’s not worth it, the phone had scratches all over the back and sides DONT BUY FROM THEM"
3454,Estado físico 9/10
3455,I ordered this coral iPhone  xr for my mother and I was so excited when I got the phone because it looks like brand new. My mother noticed that one part of the screen is dead and honestly I didn’t believe her until I try to type something on the keyboard and I noticed the backspace button doesn’t work. I tried to open another app to see if it was a software glitch but it’s not. I’m assuming it has to do with the screen. I’m going to return this phone and see if i can get another one because the quality is great is just that part of the screen that doesn’t work properly.
3456,"Disappointed in this phone, it’s impossible to hear callers unless it’s put on speaker. I’ve researched and see that many people have this problem with the xr. I wish I had knyhis before purchasing it. Also it didn’t come with with any accessories"
3457,The phone works well. Apple has never had a long battery life and this one is no different.I don’t claim to be a photographer but the pictures seem fine to me. I do like my new i phone.
3458,I love this IPhone! It Looks and works like brand new! No scratch and any flaws I could find(For a meticulous person like me)I was hesitant to buy a used iPhone (it's my 1st time to try a used one) and this phone didn’t gave me disappointment !2 thumbs up! Love it!
3459,My son loves it. It works perfectly fine. Lots of storage too
3460,works great. awesome deal 🙂 i’ve been using it for months and have had no issues.
3461,"I received my phone over 2 weeks ago. GREAT buy! I was worried with the bad reviews, but there is free returns if you you get a bad one by chance. Why not give it a shot!?Came with brand new, never opened charger cord and phone was packaged nicely."
3462,The phone works great and is a good price. Definitely worth the money. No issues so far. Also works with the phone carrier Tello.
3463,Amazing came a day earlier no scratches or defects works perfectly it came with a screen protector already on amazing phone it’s a good price too
3464,Great phone arrived really fast no scratches or dings really clean I haven't had no problems with it had it for about 2 months now works great.Would recommend to buy from this seller.
3465,"Really great product, I bought it 3 months ago and it has been working perfectly"
3466,Phone came earlier than expected and was in mint condition  came with a case and screen protecter Will order again..
3467,"This the first review I’ve ever done on Amazon and i am 110% satisfied! This phone looks 100% new and everything that came with was legit as well, very pleased with it."
3468,"Literally order this on Thursday and received on Friday! Amazing customer service, came with screen protector and charger. Perfect condition 👍🏼 Will definitely be ordering from here again."
3469,This was my first iPhone and I absolutely fell in love with all of it. The battery life is good and I couldn’t be happier.
3470,While the overall phone was in very good condition and nothing but the camera that wouldn’t focus on anything was great. The phone did not come unlocked and it was very frustrating to find out I spent almost $500 on it and it have to be returned. I have learned my lesson and I will be purchasing from Apple directly for $200 more.
3471,Did not disappoint. A great gift for someone new to the Apple iPhone family.
3472,There is nothing I dislike about this phone. I absolutely love it & it works perfectly.
3473,Just what I was looking for
3474,"The phone did not have any signs of use and the screen was in excellent condition. The phone came ready to have automatic transfer of data from old phone to new.  So far no problems, just had to learn the new techniques of the iPhone. Came with charger and cable."
3475,Item does does not work!!! The seller know their phones does not work!!!! They do not offer assistance!!!
3476,"Works exactly as described. I use straight talk service, I just popped the sim card in after software update and it works like a charm!"
3477,It was a real iphone. It came with a charger and it came with a screen protector on it. It’s battery life is spectacular!!
3478,I am glad this wasn’t a scam. I have issues with the phone I got (a crack in the corner of the screen) but it’s nothing that will definitely be the case for another buyer and the crack isn’t too bad. I just wish I had gotten a phone that wasn’t
3479,I bought the coral XR! Works great! Perfect condition! Exactly as described! Would buy from this seller again!
3480,Looks as promised and works fine. Good price and a good phone.
3481,Everything works as expected. Have had zero problems out of mine. Ordered a black 64 gig xr
3482,I recently upgraded from my iPhone 6s and I am in love with the XR. The battery is amazing!
3483,"This is a great phone, and it arrived quicker than expected. I love the features and how easy it was to set up the phone."
3484,Wow! It came so fast. It actually came before the date. And in great cosmetic condition and it works great. My fiancée is gonna love it. I’m a real person from Newark nj and not paid or nothing like that. But im a satisfied customer. And I will be purchasing again real soon. This time for myself.
3485,Just received my phone a few days ago & it was in excellent condition & the quality & battery life is like new! Super satisfied!
3486,This was my first renewed phone so i was a like nervous about what i was going to get. Thankfully all my worries were unjustified because the phone came in perfect conditions. Not a single scratch and battery status at 100%. But the best thing is that it also came with a apple guarantee that last for 8 months. The seller was Networkstore. Shipping was very fast.
3487,"Awesome experience. Phone got here a day early, was in excellent condition and we had zero issues setting it up. Very pleased with this purchase."
3488,I thought this phone would come cracked or with scratches but it came brand new with a phone case and screen protector
3489,"PERFECT condition!! The screen works great and the camera quality is amazing. The battery health is at 90%, but it said it would be at least 80% so that’s to be expected."
3490,Phone is exactly as advertised.. nothing cosmetically wrong with it that I can see.. phone was unlocked and I had no problem connecting it with my carrier
3491,I love this phone. It’s the best
3492,"This phone is literally the best. I got the black one and red for me and my daughter and they came in a day early, no scratches, in 100% good condition. We’ve had these phones for a week now and it’s just like a brand new phone. 100% recommended 10/10"
3493,Device worked perfectly and came fast no problem with sim activation at all
3494,Phone came fast and unlocked with no issues so far had it for like 3 months now
3495,The battery life was at 100% and that made me extra happy! Screen quality is awesome! I got the red and its beautiful!
3496,I refused to accept delivery of the phone as instructed by seller. I did not order the phone and did what they told me to do. I hope to receive confirmation of credit soon. The seller has been more than understanding on the two previous phone orders. Much thanks!!!
3497,I live everything on this phone specially the face recognition
3498,If these people continue to provide this great quality in pre-owned phones then I will never buy new again!
3499,"100% battery health, 0 body damage with only extremely minuscule hairline scratch on the screen. Literally top tier ROI !!!"
3500,All I like to said is that please fix the battery life issue. Otherwise it is a very good product i love it i haven't had a problem yet it just the battery life that doesn't last alot.
3501,"Overall, this phone is great! The seller is very fast and I got my phone within days.Pro- Seller is fast, and perfect condition.Con- No headphones, No attachment for headphones"
3502,"GREAT PHONE, was extremely nervous ordering a phone off of Amazon and I was not disappointed at all! 😌"
3503,Looks like a brand new phone and battery last like a new phone. No complaints at all. Wife is happy 😊 it was an Amazon prime not a third party seller.
3504,Love this phone! I bought one for my son for Christmas at his request and liked it so much I bought one for myself!
3505,It came in perfect condition.!! No scratches or damages. I love it.! I got the 64gb red
3506,la batería tiene un 90% de la capacidad original.Tenía un minúsculo rayón en la parte trasera.El telefono era supuestamente refubrish pero llegó en la aja original de apple.
3507,Lo compré para regalarlo y salió muy bueno.
3508,This by far is one of my best purchases. If I had too I would buy it again
3509,Absolutely love it! I didn’t have very high hopes but it has completely blown me away. I love this phone. I say buy it right now!!
3510,Estaba muy maltratado el celular  para el precio que costó

3516,Well worth the money!  Looks like NEW!  Fits in the shirt pocket- just want I wanted.  And it is an iphone!
3517,My phone came in today after about 2 weeks I gotta say it’s like new!!! So far so good
3518,The phone is great came with a clear case and screen protector i wish I knew that before buying a case lol
3519,The only way to know this was not a brand new phone was that it came in a generic box. Far exceeded my expectations!
3520,At first the said it was gone be delivered next week but it came the same week I ordered it and the battery life so much better than the iPhone 7
3521,amazing phone!!!!! I haven't been using it for a few months now and haven't had any problem with it. really good battery life and amazing screen size for my hand
3522,"Bought this is a gift for someone and when I opened it to check it out it was perfect !Not a scratch on it, came in great condition.Would recommend to anyone looking to save some money"
3523,"Bought this phone to upgrade from my previous android and it meets every standard. Mint condition, fantastic battery life, untouched screen. 20/10 stars for sure."
3524,"thank you CHUBBIESTECH i was anxiously waiting but i read so many good reviews about this seller i just couldnt wait to receive this phone ! i've had it for 11 days now ,it works perfect, battery life is at 93% ,has afew very light scratches but overall i'm super happy!"
3525,I was happy with what i got everything works great the battery life is a bit low but thats fine
3526,Works perfectly fine! Battery life is up to 97 percent!
3527,Camera is blurry when taking pictures…
3528,Cosmetically the phone was a 10 .I have been using the phone for about 10 days withabsolutely NO problems.The re-packaging left a little to be desired.I would recommend a refurbished phone toa friend and/or purchase another one myself.
3529,"Unit was a replacement for lost device.  Item was clean, without any obvious physical wear.  Two weeks, zero issues."
3530,The seller lied about the unlocked accommodating for all cell phone companies. Which in turn left my college student son without a Christmas gift
3531,I have had this phone since the beginning of may and it still works perfectly! occasionally glitches a tiny bit when i pull down to search for things but other than that it’s super fast and basically brand new.
3532,My son love.it Amazon sells Good stuff and the prices are excellent
3533,Phone is great. Has very minor tiny cosmetic scratches on it but does not take away from functionality. Even came with a screen protector and charger.
3534,I like the camera and facial recognition
3535,I ordered this for my mother to replace an older iphone that the volume quit working on. It works great and she loves it. No issues so far.
3536,everything about the phone is perfect!
3537,I LOVE THIS Phone this is my first iPhone ever I’m glad I picked this seller yall need to start putting headphones in there though
3538,"Loved this phone when I opened up the box, however, it didn’t work fully. Everything was great with the phone. Very few scratches on it, red color in tact, camera worked, screen worked. The biggest issue I had was when making calls I could not hear the person on the other line. Tried all kinds of fixes found in the Apple website but to no avail. I called Amazon customer service and they connected me with Apple support. Apple support tried all kinds of fixes for the phone call volume, however none worked. Apple support said there must be a problem with the hardware. Since the phone was out of warranty they could not help me any further. I had no choice but to return the phone. Tried reaching the seller by their phone number but it was just a recording each time I called. Still waiting to get a refund for this faulty product. I had high hopes for this phone, but got a dud. I hope to buy this phone again but may just break down and pay more to get it directly from Apple."
3539,"the phone works perfectly ,no scratches,camera works nicely I found the battery health at 93% . It worth it to pay 370 for this phone."
3540,"Cómo les dije en uno de mis comentarios negativos ,esto es otra cosa muy buena compra ,buena calidad,lo compre para mi niña,muy feliz ella y muy feliz yo también ,lo recomiendo ,no se van a enojar créenme ,lo dice alguien muy estricto con las cosas."
3541,Its a good phone
3542,Good phone
3543,I loved the iPhone XR. Phone wise it was a great device. I received one I couldn’t activate on AT&T. I don’t know if the seller was aware that AT&T had this device on the blacklist because it had been reported stolen but I am returning it. I assume I will get full purchase price back since it will be fully wiped by me. I’m sad but Caveat Emptor and that’s why we have Amazons return policy.
3544,Nice
3545,I was in love with the iphone. And then one day it just wouldn't turn on! no matter what I try. And ofcourse i'm past the refund date and back to square 1
3546,Saw a lot of people saying that there’s came broke and that they started to have problems but mine works fine.
3547,Great buy!! Came in great condition and battery life was over 98%
3548,Phone arrived in great condition. Has a minor scratch on the screen that I can barely even notice but otherwise it is in perfect condition. Great savings buying it renewed through Amazon!
3549,Work good 👍🏾 I’m telling u it’s like it’s brand new
3550,Dirt in speaker but still worth it
3551,"What I received was a pretty close to perfect used smartphone.  Pretty close equates to damn near perfect. No blemishes, no scratches. Operates as advertised. Glad I chose this phone."
3552,Came with 1 very small/fine scratch but other than that pretty much mint condition. I’m very satisfied with my purchase.
3553,"I was a little skeptical from reading the reviews on this phone, but decided to buy it anyways. It’s in perfect condition! Absolutely no scratches or marks. Battery life is incredible. Shipped fast and was delivered quickly. Came with charger. Overall very pleased!"
3554,The battery life is very consistent. It definitely doesn’t deplete as much as my old one. The touch screen and the screen quality is also very reliable
3555,It is a great phoneThe only issue I had was the apple logo not being on the back
3556,Great product.  Ordered Monday and received on Wednesday.  Phone is in great condition.  Clean IMEI. Using with Metro PCS. 💞

3561,The phone is perfect literally nothing wrong with it not sure why there’s so many bad reviews but my phone came in perfect condition
3562,The phone is great. But it arrived with the screen protector cracked. The seller has been unresponsive.
3563,"Perfect, no scratches, works like brand new. Battery is at 88% and seems, fine."
3564,Very nice phone. Came a day early. Battery at 90% small scratches around phone (not worried bc case will cover) everything loading smoothly!

3569,I got for my boyfriend & he loves it ! Best gift I got for him for Valentine’s Day !

3577,Great purchase! No issues at all and it’s 2 months in . Battery is at 90% but still good and lasts long.
3578,Great condition came with 97% battery life but that’s ok for me :) tiny microscopic scratches that you can’t even see when you put a tempered glass screen protector at all overall Great don’t believe the negative reviews :).
3579,"Received phone in the time frame said, phone in good condition no scratches, was able to get phone connected, would definitely buy again from this seller. Very satisfied!"
3580,"Love the phone but when you put it in your pocket, it bumps around and turns itself on. Like how fast it loads things and getting used to the absent “home” button is not that bad. Easy transition."
3581,"Bought this phone for my 13 yr old daughter , her phone was with straight talk ( Verizon ) all she had to do was stick in her sim from her old phone and put it in her new one and it worked w o any activation process 😍😍😍➕"
3582,"Agonized over this purchase for a week, so glad I bought it. Zero scratches battery health at 100%, it’s literally perfect."
3583,se siente cansado

3590,"I was very scared at first but, my phone was like brand new! There was not one crack or scratch I’m very thankful 💛💛"
3591,Great purchase! Camera is very pleasing along with battery life. Battery health was at 91% which was also good to see. As far as scratches I saw none. Very good quality. Charger was aftermarket along with port. No headphones.
3592,"I was nervous about the phone due to some of the negative reviews, but my phone came unlocked and working as if it was brand new. I haven’t had any issues with the since it came."

3594,excellent phone looks brand new and battery life is perfect would purchase from seller again

3599,Only thing I don’t like is there are scratches on the back camera other than that it’s a good phone
3600,I disliked the fact that I could have bought a brand new phone at the same price the same week I received this cell phone because the iPhone 10 was just released and all the older phone prices went down. It was a bummer as I only received the phone and a charger and I could have received the full package deal.
3601,"Bought it for my Son’s birthday. He loves it. Works great, so as the looks!"
3602,I got what I ordered.
3603,My first apple just learning on how to use and play fast loading on games easy to use Thank you
3604,I like the phone although not much different than my iPhone 7plus
3605,Mi batería no rinde. Incluso mi esposo tiene un equipo igual con un año de uso y su batería rinde más que la mía a pesar que le da mayor uso al tlf.
3606,"I’ve had the phone for a week now so far I love it. It looks brand new, great battery life. The only thing is the charger it came with doesn’t work. Luckily I had another one but other than that great purchase."
3607,This refurbished  iPhone is indistinguishable from a brand new iPhone. Set up was simple. Highly recommend.
3608,"Funciona en su totalidad, detalles mínimos de uso en el borde inferior, pero casi imperceptible, el cargador no es el original de iPhone pero funciona a la perfección. Buena compra"
3609,Was at first having a problem with shipping but phone came just in time. Everything functions fine.
3610,"I bought this renewed premium because I was hoping I would receive a better product than the one I bought as renewed. While the normal renewed came with no scratches on the body (just some on the screen) and a battery health of 89%, this one came with a battery health of 90%, a scratch on the CAMERA and a few more on the body. It’s ridiculous that I paid $100 more to receive a “premium” that is WORSE than the not premium one."
3611,I love this phone.  It looks and performs like new.  Upgraded from a flip phone and use features like FaceTime all the time.
3612,"Had 1 small scratch on the back, but other than that, it's works as if it's new."
3613,Iphone XR was in perfect condition. This actually was the second one I bought for my grandsons. I previously bought one in February. Put in Verizon sim card and phone was good to go. Would definitely buy from this company again!
3614,"At first the bad reViews scared me, because I’m in college and when I got my phone it was perfect, literally a brand new phone, just no headphones. The charger is great too."
3615,I love this phone! I’ve been wanting the newer iPhone but was indecisive because I thought it would be too expensive but luckily I found this one and it was in my price range.
3616,This phone arrived in excellent condition. Looks and works like it is brand new. I am very happy.
3617,came in good condition. works well and no complaints.
3618,Purchased this phone a month ago so far I have not experienced any problems phone works fast it’s in great conditions. Love the fact that once you receive the product it makes you do a full update etc.. Came with a screen protector as well.

3621,This is perfect my phone came in 2 days and I’m obsessed. It’s came with a case and screen protector!! Works perfectly

3623,I love it everything is just fine it works amazing I love it couldn’t ask for better👍🏾
3624,Ordered as a Replacement for an existing phone that is just like new.

3630,"I love this phone!! Has worked perfectly since I got it back in November.  I have had no issues with this phone and heavily recommended this product to those who may be skeptical about purchasing from amazon, and those looking for a phone they can trust to do the job! 👍🏾"
3631,"Very pleased with the product bought the xr 128gb, phone looks and feels like new didn’t get any headphones or oem charger but i did get a 10ft generic one overall im satisfied with the product"
3632,Had this phone for a year still going strong
3633,So far I like it I do miss the little circle button the old school iPhones had.
3634,"No complaints, in excellent condition, nothing wrong with iPhone. Hope your purchase will be as good."
3635,Phone keeps turning on and off a lot throughout the day. Wouldn’t buy again. Will end up having to bring it to a dealer to fix it.
3636,My phone came quickly and in great condition. Battery life was 94. Very happy with my purchase.
3637,Llego entero sin ningún rasguño la verdad estaba dudosa de comprar en linea pero quede encantada con el producto .
3638,The phone is great but Sometimes my screen will freeze up. I haven’t been with apple for years so I don’t know if that it was continuous thing for appl products
3639,"Have had no issues. The phone was as described, looks and performs as brand new. Very satisfied with the purchase."
3640,My son is very happy with this phone will buy from the company again if need to

3645,I love my new phone! It works great! Better than I expected! No problems!
3646,Arrived as promised in good condition. It was purchased for my son. He is happy with the upgrade from his old phone
3647,"This phone is AMAZING. Overall quality was amazing. No damage or scratches anywhere. Basically brand new, if it didn't say 'refurbished' it could pass as brand new. Instead of paying $800+ at Apple, buy from here."
3648,The product looks like new. There are small scratches on the screen but they are minimal. Comes with a case and a screen protector.
3649,Overall phone came in perfect! No scratches and the battery drains a little fast but not too bad
3650,For a used phone it’s literally brand new. I can’t find a scratch on it. 96% battery life. I read a lot of bad reviews and was very skeptical at first but I am very satisfied!! I will post an update if I have any problems that turn up
3651,"Do you need trash for $230? Then buy it! Scratches on back side, missing pixels, bad condition of the speaker."
3652,I was a bit hesitant till I read the reviews the good out weighs bad so I took my shot I finally got it today and set it up came with a screen protector surprised it was brand new unlocked and perfect all around. I highly recommend.
3653,"I was skeptical to buy an iphone on amazon, especially because i just got my husband this same phone from att for 800$... phone is perfect! I am kicking myself for spending double through the phone company. This iphone xr is perfect! And amazon guarantees for 90 days!"
3654,"this phone is unlocked but my only problem is, it goes dead real quickly and the charge doesnt last long but i just put the phone on battery saving mode. Overall this phone is execllent."
3655,"I bought this as a gift and when the recipient activated the phone per instructions, the Facial ID did not work for any users. The phone states the TrueDepth camera (infrared) is faulty. Unfortunately, the return window had passed. This is my first negative experience with a refurbished iPhone."
3656,"Love this phone , not a single scratch or tear , automatically came with a tinted color screen protector"
3657,No trae los auriculares. Y el cargador no es el original.
3658,It showed up early and is in great condition. Would certainly purchase from this vendor again
3659,"I love the iPhone XR, but for some reason the phone battery dies too quickly and the touch screen lags and makes me tap several times. I had an XR on another carrier and it was awesome, but couldn't unlock it for some reason."
3660,"This is exactly what I was expecting, I give it 10/10. Wish they would also give the box but its whatever!"
3661,Perfect. Love it
3662,"Nice phone, great condition, fast shipping."
3663,"I was uneasy buying a phone on here but now looking at it, it was worth it. I had a iPhone 6s Plus with a crappy battery life and I was in despite need of a new phone. So I wanted it and I got it lol"
3664,"I love this phone so so Much, looked hells sketch until I bought . Making this review. On the phone actually! Super nice and really big. Kinda sad that it didn't come with headphones😢 but overall an absolute pleasure of a iPhone☺️☺️☺️😊😊"
3665,I like the phone in general but the fact the the screen come scratched I didn't like very much because it took away form the overall quality of the phone.
3666,Buen producto
3667,The whole screen went out in 2 weeks. The cost to replace was $225 dollars. The repair technician said this phone had NEVER been refurbished! Total lies from this seller! Buyer BEWARE!
3668,The battery doesn’t keep charge for very long. Runs down really fast….and the phone gets really hot while charging.
3669,This phone was exactly as described. Found no issues with the phone.
3670,"I ordered this phone and it came with a defect on the screen- where it had been damaged. The screen was scratched up from prior use and had an old screen protector on it. The phone is slow and you can tell something has happened to it. If they are going to sell products at this quality it should be HALF as much as they are selling it for. Not original charger, no headphones."
3671,"Beautiful, tbh I was scared to buy my first iPhone ever, online. But I didn’t it and I’m so glad I did so cheap so nice. Perfect condition."
3672,Excede las expectativas
3673,"It took a little while for it to arrive. But other than that it is a great phone, nice pictures, its pretty heavy though. But iPhones are not for me, I'm going back to Samsung"
3674,The iPhone Xr was in good condition just had a little scratches on the phone.
3675,"I skeptical about buying this phone , but I am so so so grateful that I did! It is cheap, and the phone looks brand new!"
3676,I used it for a Bring your own phone.  Very happy with it.  Just wish I had a manual for it.
3677,Battery runs out too quickly sound quality is poor
3678,"I just want my phone replaced with a different one I swear. It just Over heats constantly and my speaker phone has never worked properly. Sure I can it back but as I work in surgery I kinda need the new one before I can send this one back. Will I ever buy from y'all agin? Hell no,not if you can't replace a detective product"
3679,"we like the product,specially when its backed by Amazone."
3680,"Absolutely PERFECT and FLAWLESS. I was weary about purchasing a renewed phone but it arrived fast, packaged well and looks and operates just like a new phone. Purchase with confidence."
3681,Love my new refurbished phone. It is like new
3682,Battery life - A1Touch screen - perfectScreen quality- 😘🤌🏾It’s like it’s a brand new phone and I am in loveee
3683,I can’t hear other people speak on my phone unless I have it on speaker!!!!
3684,Muy buen producto 👍
3685,I was really hesitant to buy a renewed phone. But I heard good stories online so bought this XR renewed. At a substantially cheaper price than new. I pretty much got a new phone. I wouldn’t even know the difference honestly. So far so good (a month in). If something goes wrong I’ll update.
3686,Too much scratches!! And dirty when I received it.
3687,I received my iphone xr yellow in the mail a day before it was suppost to be here. Everything works like new. There was a little scratch on the glass but you cant feel it and it's not really noticeable at all. Over all it's a great phone
3688,The phone looks quite new and has every functionality in working condition. I haven't have encountered any problems yet.
3689,"Looks great works great, battery life don’t last but about 3/4 of a day but good phone"
3690,"Great battery life, good screen size and a super reliable phone. I love it"
3691,i had no problems looked brand new amazing phone
3692,I am so disappointed with the phone.....I can't get it to stop repeating every letter when I type and the light on the screen will not stay on so I have a very hard time seeing my messages....I have asked AT+T to  help several times but it doesn't last  I'm sorry I bought this phones
3693,Looked brand new out of box. Moved SIM card from old phone without a problem. Phone works great. Highly recommend this company.
3694,"If you add the original box, you don't even notice this is a renewed phone, super clean."
3695,Works great! No scratches or cracks in like new condition it’s just but when I got it it was at 90% battery health which I don’t mind
3696,"Great quality item, and very slim"
3697,I thought it was a scam but my phone came in 1 business work so good and look brand new no problems at all they sent me a extra charger to ...highly recommend this product by this company
3698,This Phone is amazing honestly I couldn’t ask for anything better. 1000% sure you should buy your phones from this company 10/10❤️
3699,"I was extremely nervous buying this, but not only did my phone come in perfect condition, they provided a phone case, charger & glass screen protector!!! It came a day early and went above & beyond my expectations!!"
3700,All good
3701,Pretty Good overall only problem is that videos on youtube and tiktok seem to be slightly zoomed like someone did a bad job cropping it
3702,I would highly recommend getting this phone mine came in in perfect condition no scratches not cracks it's perfect
3703,The phone is in excellent condition & we received it faster than expected.
3704,Perfect condition. Switched my SIM card to my new phone with no problems.  At first I didn’t realize I had to call my carrier to transfer my service to my new phone. Came with charger and everything  worked great.
3705,"Phone came in excellent condition, has worked great for the months I have owned it thus far. I would use them again."
3706,I love my phone it came perfect and fast shipping. Good battery good touch screen and screen quality.
3707,This phone is wonderful.  It was a great value and works perfectly
3708,"I've always disliked buying items at a full price, although it's kind of expected that renewed items won't always function. The phone itself seemed like it was a perfectly new conditioned phone. Although there were some issues with the volume when wanting to call someone, and it was just terrible with the low quality and volume. Plus the time on looking at tutorials to fix these issues seemed frustrating since a majority won't solve the issue. Just a bunch of issue's piling up after one another. Now my issue is that the home screen is just zoomed in, unable to get into the lock screen, and unable to hard turn off the device. It's not worth buying a renewed phone, best chances is to actually buy this product from the apple store. I've already done a refund and will never again purchase anything from this seller. What a disappointment this was."
3709,"El teléfono llego en buenas condiciones un poco rayado en la parte posterior, y la condición de la batería es de %89, se puede notar la baja del rendimiento por este motivo. Pero por lo general buena compra."
3710,This phone is definitely worth the money. The phone came in a very professional packaging (not original packaging but I don’t mind) along with a charger and a screen protector which was great! The phone is free of scratch and dents and I was so impressed considering the price. It’s running smoothly and fine.
3711,"Everything but just a few scratches on the outside of my camera, works fine tho but if you’re looking for something that isn’t a for sure thing don’t buy from this company because mine was not completely refurbished"
3712,Very fast delivery ! It came a whole day early . Dope ass quality. Highly recommended
3713,was very iffy about ordering one from the negative reviews. im glad i did its perfect flawless came with the plastic still on it. battery health is 95%. i love the phone already. deff would reccomend. im using on metro by t-mobile
3714,"Me gusta mucho la camara que tiene el telefono, todos los samsung tienen muy buena nitidez"
3715,The phone arrived on time and just as stated in the details.As other reviewers stated- it came in a generic box with generic charger but the product is an apple product and works fine.
3716,Great quality and they sent me Gear4 case !!! No complaints just glad it’s exactly how it should be
3717,I purchased this phone for my daughter and she loves it. Excellent upgrade from her previous iphone 6S plus.
3718,"Phone came on time. No scratches, powered right up. Works like new. Very pleased."
3719,"Excellent condition , not a single scratch. Although, taking  a star off only because of battery life being at 94%."
3720,As advertised.  The phone was in outstanding condition.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase from this seller.
3721,It works so good and it saved me a lot of money from which I was originally going to pay for this phone.
3722,"Got exactly what I paid for, work as new. Worth the money ! Would definitely recommend!!"
3723,this phone is BRAND NEW i refuse that this was used! no scratches AND FAST SHIPPINGGGG came abt 5-6 days sooner than said. i'm in love!! im so glad it came with a warranty.
3724,Once i opened the box the phone was on and when i was going to log in my iCloud the phone shutoff it had charge and it kept rebooting stayed on the apple sign and it repeated green lines on the screen🤦🏻‍♀️
3725,theres a pretty heavy lag when using the camera to take pictures or videos. when you take pictures just expect them to be taken a second or so after you press the button.
3726,Bought this phone for my wife for Christmas.  Phone has been good.  No problems with crashing or battery life.
3727,"So far the phone works really good, except the battery life isn’t what I thought it would be, but other than that, phone looked new and I’m happy for the purchase"
3728,"Absolutely love this phone! There is no visible evidence of it being a refurbished phone at all. I received it a day earlier than expected. I’ve had it for about a month now & I’m very happy with my purchase, definitely worth the money!"
3729,Works very well!!! Looks super good too! It was also packaged nicely and delivered without any issues! 10000/10 recommend this!
3730,We were shocked at what great shape the phone was in! It was in perfect condition. Could not have been happier.
3731,I ordered this phone for my son. The phone looked brand new and I found absolutely no defects. The battery life was at 88%.  I would gladly buy another.
3732,"Work looks like new, works perfectly, I haven’t had issues yet, I’m loving it!"
3733,"I bought my phone the iPhone XR for Christmas, works great no problems with it at all . I purchased a second one for my other sons birthday , and we just got It yesterday looks brand new and works great . love it !!"
3734,battery health reduced to 66% after less than 2 months and customer care refuses to compensate or even respond
3735,"I was a little skeptical about buying this iPhone because of previous reviews, but let me say the phone just came in & is AMAZING!!! everything is working great!"
3736,"Been roughly 6 months since I've had this device. Still looks & works great. Wish I had gotten the 256gb model though, coming from an iPhone 7 128gb."
3737,So far so good. It’s the first day so I’ll see if it changes. I’ve read all the good reviews so I’m feeling pretty confident.
3738,"It works like a brand new one, can't find any difference at all from previous brand new ones that I had."
3739,I'm so happy with this phone. I have one for work and loved it so much I got my own. The refurbished phone is in perfect shape.
3740,"This phone is perfect! Didn’t come to me cracked or even scratched! I even went on the apple website to make sure it was real, and it is!"
3741,Had it for a month. No troubles
3742,Screen was cracked
3743,Everything was as in the description of the device. Traces of use are negligible. I recommend the seller.
3744,Refurbished phone that looked like new! My daughter has had this for a couple of months now and it works like a charm. Haven't had any problems. She couldn't be happier with it. Happy daughter=happy Momma!
3745,I was satisfied with purchase. Looks like new. Bought 3 months ago . Phone still functions as should .
3746,"No es un engaño, le compré este teléfono a mi hermano y está súper feliz. Le doy 5 estrella muchas gracias."
3747,I ordered this phone as an upgrade from my 6s which was outdated and slow. Amazon guaranteed that the new phone that’s I ordered would be just like new. That was definitly not the case. When I red or Ed the package the back glass was scratched all up. Later when I transferred SIM cards my Verizon account was frozen because the phone was labeled as stolen. Also the phone is supposed to be water resistant and could be submerged but I took it camping and went into the showers with it. After the shower it strobed black and white but when soaked In rice it was fixed. All in all it’s safe to say that I will return this and get a refund.
3748,"i was so hesitant in buying this phone because of a few bad reviews but I AM SOOO happy i bought it, came in perfect condition and full charge. really recommend!"
3749,"At the start, the phone worked mostly. Could take phones, phone calls, can work with apps. In the first week or so, the only thing that didn't work was the Face ID feature.Recently, three weeks after we received the phone, the camera froze from time to time, and the phone turned off by itself when we tried to set an alarm. It seems that the phone is going to lose more functionality as weeks go by. Very disappointing. We are not sure how overseas order can benefit from the return policy. Certainly it will be costly in terms of time delay, let alone the cost of sending it back."
3750,"product came nicely packaged and came with a charger, and SCREEN PROTECTOR! beyond happy with this purchase!"
3751,"We have not noticed any flaws with the battery life, the screen was flawless. Looks and works great so far!!"
3752,Great condition. Clean. I would absolutely buy from them again.
3753,Bought this as an upgrade for my husband and it works very well. It came fully unlocked. We paid $16 to get it registered with metro PCS. The camera is awesome and lots of storage space.
3754,"El teléfono vino con 100% de batería, funda y vidrio templado de regalo e impecable estado. Muy contento con esta compra."
3755,"Product came in great condition, just wish it came with a sim card"
3756,The speaker is not a 100 but it can work with. The phone looks like new arrive on time . I love it best decision I’ve made all year was to buy this phone
3757,like new
3758,Very good every thing works well
3759,"No noticeable scratches or scuffs, the battery is at 100%, there’s no flaws or damages to the screen, no glitches in the software, it even came with a screen protector already on it. Very happy with this purchase"
3760,It a great phone
3761,Love the product color red for it.... Works amazing... screen equality and camera quality is A1 sauce amazing... amosc @jullio.rel
3762,Everything is great works fine other then having issues making and receiving calls people can call me or I can call them but as soon as either party picks up it disconnects but internet and everything else works fine as does calls on Facebook messenger
3763,According to my child...a perfect holiday gift....absolutely loves it and it seems to work fine
3764,"Came with a phone case and screen protector as gifts!! Phone is great, very happy costumer!!"
3765,"It works perfectly, nothing was wrong when arrived and I have been using it for months now and nothing is going wrong"
3766,Better than expected with phone thanks to Amazon for an upgrade on a phone for being unlocked and everything
3767,AMAZING! i just received my new phone. A DAY EARLY! after setting up it works great!! the battery life is 100% and there are absolutely no scratches or dents!
3768,"Keeps phone clean and dry, great for keeping your phone safe!"
3769,"Great restored phone. I have bought numerous restored phones in the past and this one is definitely the best I’ve had. Had it for about a month now, and no issues I can tell. Battery life is great, everything seems to operate as it should. This is a good buy!"
3770,"I've been using this for about a month now and it works great! The only hassle was calling up my phone company and switching the sim card from my old iphone, but on the upside I could do that from home instead of going into the store to have them make the transfer."
3771,"This iPhone is Awesome, I've had no problems with it at all"
3772,I ordered a 128gb iPhone xr. I received the phone today and the day home looks brand new  battery health is at 85% which is good and it's been working good so far and it's completely unlocked thanks Verizon pre-owned
3773,"i absolutely DESPISE the apple store, so when i saw that the xr was for 600$ i didnt believe it at first, i expected to get some obviously counterfeit or slightly damaged goods, but instead i got a high performing spotless phone, i cant really believe it tbh but so far its performed very well"
3774,"Everything was good, I used it a lot so the battery life is ok and the touch screen is ok well."
3775,"The seller was terrific and package arrived promptly, phone was well packaged and I’m happy with it."
3776,Everything turned out alright it was like new you only get the phone and charger so I wouldn’t recommend this is if you want the apple experience with original box and everything but if you don’t care about all that then save some money and buy this but also think about the is purchase because it is still a lot of money
3777,This product is awesome. I was scared because it was so cheap but it turned out to be fine. Everything works perfectly fine and it even came two days early! 100% recommend
3778,Everything  is fine with the iPhone XR. Only minor scratch made me not 100% happy!
3779,Love my new phone! Even better that it came with a charger!! What a great surprise!!
3780,It came better than expected I found NO SCRATCHES or DAMAGE I got it with 91% battery life and it also came with a free phone case
3781,"Seller was very accommodating on request for refund, phone wasn’t the right one for us, but seller was great."
3782,This is amazing! I just upgraded from a 6s cracked almost completely broken phone to this mint perfect coral xr! It’s truly beautiful and you’ve got to hold it for yourself to see how great it is! All around amazing!

3786,Everything seems good with the phone but battery life is choppy.
3787,"Great purchase great price! I purchased this phone for my fiancé who’s old phone was dying. Even though he was an android user before, it didn’t take long to adjust. He loves it."
3788,"Excellent. The only thing I didn't like was that the battery had 95% service life. No aesthetic details, perfect screen."
3789,"When you purchase this, you get exactly what you want! It came in perfect condition but one scratch on the screen, but it was very minor and I had to look for it. The battery came with 100% capacity and was overall perfect! I definitely recommend purchasing from this company!"

3796,"No noticeable scratch or marks on the phone. Looks and operate like it should, was even delivered a few days quicker than it was scheduled for. I'm very happy with the product since I was very conscious about spending money on a refurbished item from an online seller."
3797,"Got the phone and it was very slow at launching  apps, phone kept shutting down even though it was fully charged. Ordered a replacement battery which was more money i had to spend, now it works fine. Whole process annoying. Very dissapointed. The battery was like melted inside looks like it was never checked."
3798,Been about a month and a half now. Works great 👏🏽

3816,"I bought if for my wife, it old phone was acting weird.  It’s like brand new, no scuffs or scratches.  I’m satisfied with the order."

3834,Everything is working good. I like it.
3835,"My kid saved money for months to pay for most of this phone and was so proud of it. But just a few weeks past the return window (90 days) set by the seller Maverick Wireless, the screen began showing blank stripes. It had not been dropped or damaged. Apple's troubleshooting system sent me to Best Buy for repair, but staff there told me the cause was an expanding battery, pressing on the screen. If you looked at the phone sidways, you could see the expansion. That means the battery is malfunctioning and pressure is building up inside such that it could burst, a severe fire hazard. They told me the phone should be consdidered hazardous waste. Amazon, Apple, and the seller (Maverick Wireless) all refused to refund any money for this defective phone. A ""like new"" battery does not fail internally after less than 4 months for no reason, making the phone hazardous waste."
3836,"Llego antes de lo esperado🙌Muy bello color, y pues trae cargador y el telefono esta desbloqueado a mi me Sirvio para ponerle un chip de Cricket.  Muy buena compra por ser el primer día con el celular espero no de ningún problema"
3837,I bought an excellent condition iPhone. There are too many scratches and the battery health is only 80%. It’s not excellent at all!

3839,"Great product. It was supposed ro come on Friday, but I recieved it on Wednessday. Perect condition, came with the proper charger everything nice, sleek and perfect."
3840,Just received my new phone and it’s in perfect condition. Absolutely skeptical at first but it didn’t fail everything works perfectly
3841,After a few weeks two black dots or blots appeared on my screen. I hadn’t dropped it and had a case and screen protector on it. Doesn’t effect much but when u pay so much for a phone u don’t want that
3842,"Bought this iphone for my son because he made the honor roll at his school so proud and happy he loves his phone, everything works no scratches just perfect."
3843,I love my phone excellent condition.  This is my 5th iPhone I purchased on Amazon and everyone has been excellent condition
3844,Phone was excellent.  Had an issue setting up service with my carrier ATT.
3845,It's a phone!!  Works great in all capacities.
3846,Bought it for my son was able to transfer all his stuff from old iphone no problem and just put sim card in and was good to go phone looked like it just came out of a box like new
3847,Just received the phone. Already activated to Cricket wireless. So far so Good. No scratches on the phone.
3848,"Phone is not unlocked to carriers and when you try to add it to any service provider they will say the imei number is invalid meaning it’s not a real device. I made the seller aware of the issue and was ensured I would be refunded. I placed the phone in a plain box and secured the phone with foam. After reaching out multiple times, I get a message saying “unfortunately the time is damaged and we can’t refund you because we don’t cover physical damage”. I made them aware that the item wasn’t damaged when I shipped it! THE WHOLE ISSUE IS THIS PHONE HAS A FALSE IMEI # AND CANNOT CONNECT TO CARRIERS So it’s basically a brick. All they keep saying is they can’t do anything. I’m pretty sure the phone was intentionally cracked so that they could continue with there scam and not refund me. I didn’t even ask for an actual refund. I just wanted the phone unlocked the way it is advertised. So now I’m out of $500 with a brick... that’s now magically cracked. PLEASE BE CAREFUL!"
3849,I LOVE THIS PHONE! My mom bought me this phone!! Everyone keeps saying the charger it came with doesn’t work but mine did!
3850,We bought two phones from here and one of them had some issues. Fortunately they were extremely helpful getting us a replacement phone and now their both perfect. Definitely worth the price. I couldn’t have been happier with the customer support.
3851,This phone looks brand new.  I love the size and the color of the phone.
3852,Don’t listen to the other reviews! This phone is absolutely perfect like brand new! I loved it!
3853,So far is good works great looks great and im happy for the price that it was
3854,"This product, I was skeptical of purchasing because of the reviews, but don’t listen to them! The phone came brand new! Along with an original charger, but the box wasn’t an Apple one. I’ve had it since October and I’m in love! I highly recommend this product at this price!"
3855,El micrófono requirió de una limpieza al igual que la bocina para llamadas para funcionar bien.Uno de los dos altavoces no funciona.
3856,Love the phone no problem with it
3857,It is very hard for others to hear me when I talk to them on the phone like the microphone is broken.
3858,"Very nice phone. Of course it doesnt come with a factory charger, but it didn’t really matter considering I used a wireless charger. Phone was almost completely brand new. No scratches are smudges whatsoever. Great phone for a fraction of the price at a cell carrier."
3859,"I was scared of buying but  No problems so far! Had the phone for about a week now and it really looks like a new phone , thank you!"
3860,"Good thing customer service is fast because you may be sending back your phone. I bought 2 and one of them had a permanent mark of the camera from the back of the phone, on the inside of the screen. Unacceptable. And the color of the lighting between the 2 was very different. One had a very bright white look and the other had a very distorted look. Customer service was quick to send return labels, so good luck."
3861,Works great didn't get a 100% battery capacity
3862,I reached out to the seller multiple times. As soon as I received this item.  Unfortunately I have yet to receive a response.  (My issue with the item is the top of the touch screen does not work. Meaning it does not respond to the touch of my fingers.
3863,This phone is amazing for the price! Works great and was SUPER easy to set up! Arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered. Comes with a charger that works and charges fast!! I recommend this seller.

3900,The battery life was at 92% when I bought it which was a pleasant surprise. The phone came like new and unlocked.
3901,"I was a little nervous to purchase this because of some of the bad reviews, but the phone came in perfect condition. I just popped my sim out of my old phone and popped it into the XR and it worked beautifully with no hiccups!"

3904,I got this phone as a Christmas gift for someone and the phone look brand new and it work perfectly
3905,I ordered the renewed version thinking it will not be identified. However the phone that I got had too many scratches and the camera was also scratched. Highly disappointed! I immediately requested for return and ordered a new iPhone 11 from Apple’s own website.

3915,It was a good product for a great price
3916,"Ordered the 128gb iPhone XR. I was a little unsure about the whole renewed/refurbished thing but I was pleasantly surprised. It came in a plain white box, but the phone was in perfect condition and it came with a charger and cord. No issues setting it up and it works perfect!"
3917,Me encantó vino perfecto mi iPhone XR y con un Case transparente de regalo
3918,"They had a disclaimer upfront that the battery was at least at 80% capacity. So I thought ""Cool, that just means the phone will die a little faster. This was the case and then some. As I was transferring my things from my old phone to my new one, I kept the new one on the charger and fully charged it before use. When the transfer was done I was very content with my new iPhone and was readily exploring the new features. The first thing I noticed was that the new phone was unable to display the battery percentage, I found this pretty odd since every other phone can do this simple feature. A few minutes later, I receive a prompt letting me know that the battery in my iPhone was not genuine and that I needed to call apple support. After a conversation with apple support, they suggested that I send the phone in for diagnostics and repairs, and because we are amid a global pandemic, I knew this would take forever, but I had no choice. So this now leaves me 3 weeks later with no phone back and a feeling of regret."
3919,It was working fine for the the first 3 months that the warranty covered. But then the battery life dropped by 3-4% in a matter of weeks.
3920,This phone looks and acts as if it was brand new. Very impressed! Thank you!

3924,"Pretty much everything on the phone works fine except the most important part which is the mic. When i call i can perfectly hear the other person, but i have to pretty much scream into the mic for them to hear me"
3925,Sometimes button doesn’t work so you have to repeatedly press till it works.  Happens randomly not very often
3926,"The phone prices in my country are high, So to get one at this rate is amazing. when I got it, the condition of it was perfect. camera quality is great. Best phone!"

3964,"The phone worked great for about 2 weeks and then one day when unlocking the phone it would take about a minute for the screen to come on and within an hour the screen completely stopped coming on. I was glad it at least happened in the return window. EXCEPT they approved me for a return and only refunded my half my money. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. Literally had not dropped the phone, gotten it wet, it had been in my pocket while I was in class and started acting up after."
3965,I honestly thought I was gonna get punked but this is the real deal! And for a good bit less than what you would pay buying it in store. Bought it with prime and it came even earlier than expected in absolute perfect condition!!
3966,Great

3968,So I’m sure there is still time for something to go wrong but I was SO skeptica to order a phone from here... but the one I got is beautiful!!! Not a single scratch.

3972,I thought this was aGood deal and so far I am very happy with it!
3973,"This was for my granddaughter and until today when someone stole it she has totally enjoyed the phone.  No complaints at all,"
3974,Like brand new ! Wouldn’t know the difference
3975,"If I could give this a rating of a zero,  I would because that's how bad it is.  I had an older iPhone 6 and it works way better than this.  I updated to this phone because I bought the Apple series 5 watch and it required a newer IPhone to work with it.  This XR phone keeps dropping calls.  Many times I'm not able to dial out.  What's the point of having a phone if your calls keep dropping?  2nd major issue is when I'm away from my house,  I'm not able to use my data.  Hence,  I'm not able to connect.  Even when I'm home and use wifi data,  I would lose connection.  I would be on Facetime with my mom and so often,  I would lose connection.  3rd, the battery gets hot very fast.  Again,  I never had any of these issues with my iPhone 6.  I wanted to return the phone,  but I was told I was a month to late.  I only had the phone for 4 months."
3976,Muy buen teléfono vino en muy buen estado y con vidrio templado adicional
3977,Works great looks great
3978,Everything works perfect and my son is so happy!
3979,"Loveeee! So happy that I took a chance to get this renewed phone instead of full price for it. It works beautifully. No scratches, no dents. That perfect apple quality. 100% recommend."
3980,Phone had no imei so it cannot be activated when i tried to return it the seller  they refused to give me a refund now am stuck with a phone that doesn't work. Worst experience ever
3981,Perfect iPhone no scratches . I just wished that it came with an original charger but so far so good.
3982,The face recognition and the battery life are great but the speaker is awful. No one can hear me when I am on speaker.
3983,When I got the phone it looked great but then a month later the phone went black out of nowhere. I’m now spending 200 dollars more to get the wire in the phone fixed. I had to get the wire ordered at a cell phone fix it store. It’s taking another month just to get that part done. I don’t know if this was such a great buy. I won’t buy from them again.
3984,"Came with everything it said it would. Works like a brand new phone. Even came with tempered glass already on it, which is awesome because I forgot to order some."
3985,"I was expecting more of a battery life, but I'm satisfied overall. This phone looks like new."
3986,Came In Great Condition Nothing Wrong What So Ever
3987,Mine was absolutely new! Had a 100% battery life even though I bought the regular one instead of the premium!
3988,Its perfect smart phone
3989,I asked for black but got red instead but other than that it’s good so far
3990,I’m completely surprised at the quality of the phone.  Not a scratch or mark that I can find.  Battery health at 100%.  I’ve had it for five days and it seems flawless.  Everything functions so far.It still has some Apple warranty left as well.
3991,Came early and the phone was perfect no scratches and has a battery life of 100%. Great service easy and affordable. I highly recommend if you don’t mind missing out on the luxury unboxing of apple products.
3992,"Phone works good ,looks brand new this is my first I phone so idk how I feel about it in that way yet but other then that great phone works with cricket that’s what I’m using"
3993,My son loves his phone. The iphone came in perfect conditions good battery life everything works well.

3999,"I love it👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 Bro it’s in perfect condition and everything. edit: i broke my xr and ive been using my 6 and since i ordered from yall before i decided to do it again. bro you cannot tell that its refurbished , i was thinking it would be a little damaged because the xr was released years ago. thanks guys, yall never disappoint"
4000,This phone was exactly what I ordered. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. I will order again when I need to.
4001,The battery doesn’t last long at all
4002,"Good as new; I feel bad I didn’t pay more for it. Everything works just fine, no scratches or dents or any signs of use visible at all. Brand new device. Literally."
4003,I absolutely love this phone it’s works just fine and it didn’t have and dumps or dints looks new and works great..it didn’t come in a Apple box or have an Apple charger buts other then that live it
4004,"Easy to setup , long battery life, no scratches or dents. Looked like a brand new phone."
4005,The phone itself is in great shape but the one I was sent is locked by ustracfone/straighttalk
4006,I was ver sceptical about buying a $500 phone on Amazon but it is totally worth it. The battery says 100% and nothing wrong with this phone. I would totally recommend this seller and this phone. iPhone XR Yellow
4007,Love this phone and it even came a day earlier than expected😊
4008,"The phone did work, but it was scratched and cracked in a few places. It still worked fine, but came with some screen issues."
4009,"Have not used it yet. Will review in the future.What I can say, it is a most excellent phone at a very good price. AND, not a scratch on it!  Excellent service as well !!!!!!!!"
4010,I offered it to my husband and it works very well until now no complain. Everything looks and works as new. We are very happy to buy second hand so we are not contributing to produce more phones and so contribute to 21th century slave. Definitely recommended
4011,I used it for my personal use
4012,I did dislike how you put my iPhone XR  in a generic box instead of an Apple iPhone box.And I really like my iPhone because its black.

4031,I was scared but it came and no problems so far I’m impressed
4032,the product is fine but I am tired of being asked to rate it over and over enough
4033,"The phone is great and came in working condition, nothing wrong with the software and wasn’t blacklisted so that was a plus. However, the screen had multiple scratches (some of which were very noticeable) on the screen as well as on the back. Was disappointed but the phone is amazing."
4034,Absolute MINT condition.  Not one scratch or blemish.  Absolute new condition.  100% battery health...how can that be with a reconditioned iPhone???  Great packaging.  Extremely happy with this purchase.  NOTE - I very rarely review my purchases.
4035,It is exactly what my daughter wanted. It looked new

4046,Face recognition is great clear screen quality and long battery life
4047,                    The media could not be loaded.                 There’s no problem with it.. I mean besides the tiny scratches under the the back camera there’s no real damage to the phone.
4048,It meant all expectations and more. very Good Purchase
4049,Battery was at like 90% but its not that bad
4050,"Todo perfecto, es como si realmente estubiera nuevo."
4051,Other than the cutting edge camera. The XR keeps up with the iPhone 12 step-for-step. Excellent!
4052,Great price! Excellent quality! Like it was new!
4053,This I got for my grandson. He lives in another State.
4054,This one works well . Haven’t had any issues so far. Ordered the coral one originally and had issues. The phone didn’t work after a month. But this one has been great.
4055,"Was worried after I read reviews of others poor experience. The phone i received was in great condition, battery life is at 94% & have not had any problems"
4056,Nice
4057,I love it! It comes with a glass screen protector and it’s already on the phone! Also came with a high quality charger! Tysm!
4058,"The phone came with a glass screen protector. When removed, there was a huge deep scratched from the top of the phone down to the bottom. At first I thought the phone was cracked but after taking it into a cell phone store, it was confirmed that the phone was badly scratched."
4059,I thought my girlfriend was crazy when see keep saying the phone didn't have service and wasn't getting texts messages.So 4 months ago I got her a new phone and had this iPhone X laying around and I gave it to my buddy thinking theres nothing wrong with it. Well I was wrong within 2 days he called me from another number and told me the same problems my girlfriend said she had with the phone.So I believe the issue is the sim card reader and its been a problem but I didn't listen and now I might be stuck with a very nice hardly used iPhone X. That doesn't work
4060,"Came early to my surprise. Packaged weird no block. But it is working properly. So, I'm satisfied."
4061,Love this phone. Great battery life. Great screen quality.
4062,"Would definitely buy it again, product works great, in great condition.  Arrived way earlier than expected!"

4064,Screen quality is perfect no scratches very impressed
4065,Battery was weak. Other than that great.
4066,"Bought a phone on amazon before. I was scammed out of my money on that one. This one I was skeptical, but, I’m so happy I did!!! Such an amazing phone!"

4078,Zuper good service and the phone look like new not problem i recomend the seller
4079,"I didn’t come with a box, just wrapped with some plastic bag, the plug is cheap made, neither plug nor cables were OEM. It doesn’t have apple logo on it. The price dropped almost $50 right after I purchased it. What a rip off. The positive thing about this phone is it works good so far."
4080,Love how much bigger the screen is. A little heavier then I was expecting
4081,Everything was ok
4082,i like it

4090,Perfect condition! No scratches. Works great!
4091,"Great shape, fast shipping"
4092,"Happy so far. It is exactly what it says. How the quality of this refurbished phone is, only time will tell."
4093,As good as new; bought it as a gift a few weeks ago and is working flawlessly.
4094,"Loved everything about this phone, especially the 98% battery health"
4095,"Good battery life, good screen resolution and fast page load. Face ID works excellent!"
4096,Great phone. But battery life doesn’t last long as suppose to.
4097,It came in and all was well! Love how cheap it was too!
4098,"I received it early and looks good for the price, just a few minor scratches and no headphones but it was expected like it said on the descriptions, i was reading some reviews and i was worried but i got my phone in good condition working perfect"
4099,Had problems where other people could not understand what was being said from time to time. Brightness wasn’t very good.
4100,It’s a great phone but the problem was the battery wasn’t at 100% battery life
4101,You can tell she isn’t brand new. But she is good. She do alright
4102,It’s what you expect Maybe the battery life could be lower than expected.otherwise there’s no problem.
4103,"Phone looks brand new and is fully unlocked, very satisfied."
4104,"It’s only been a couple months since I bought the red iPhone XR but it arrived looking brand new and I’ve had zero issues with it, glad I bought it here vs buying it brand new."
4105,Phone came BRAND NEW!!! I was shockedIt had no scratches or dents no scuffs of any kind. Came with a certified apple cord and brick and a headphones. Unfortunately no screen protector. Battery health was on a 100%. It’s worth it
4106,Came on time with a battery life of 98% no scratches or cosmetic damages at all so far has been a great phone would definitely buy again !
4107,"Awesome, in excellent condition and fast shipment!!!"
4108,This phone is great! Almost brand new with one tiny scratch that I can barely see. The battery was at 100%. highly recommend this seller if you’re looking to buy a phone
4109,Looks and works like new. Battery health was 100% out of the box. Glass was perfect. My daughter is happy with it. Came with generic charger as described.
4110,"Product came as described, in a generic box with a generic off brand charger. They mention this in the description somewhere so I wasn't necessarily disappointed. Did not come with headphones though. Phone works like new and it says it has 90% battery capacity. Overall happy with my new phone."
4111,I am from South America and the device worked great. There a minute scratches but nothing noticable.
4112,It’s great. Not a single scratch. I put my SIM card in and it automatically worked and my service and everything was up there. I was scared at first but I’m glad that I bought it !!
4113,"Product came broken with a small nick on the top of the screen, that was what it was but guess what. A few days later bam, no cell service at all works on the phone anymore! Are you kidding me? Went to TMobile they changed the sim, did a few other troubleshooting things and finally reset the whole phone. Nothing work cellular antenna was dead. Sent this pos back quick."
4114,This phone works well everything functions as it should battery live isn’t as good as brand new but gets the job done. Only complaint is a rattle sound from the top right corner from speakers.
4115,Wishe they would have added that the speakers were bad.
4116,The back of the phone was not greater
4117,Works perfectly fine just freeze every once in a while other then that I love it.
4118,Speaker of earpiece was broken had to take the phone to get it fixed a day after purchasing everything else worked fine
4119,product was perfect except there is one little scratch on my screen
4120,"Phone came earlier then expected, no scratches or blemishes. Looks brand new. Battery life is 95%, not bad for renewed phone. Happy with my purchase. Buyspry was my seller.Will update if any issues come up!"
4121,I almost told my boyfriend not to order this because I seen so many bad comments but the phone was perfect! He absolutely loves it and everything on it works fine.
4122,Audio not the best. Didn't have another phone to use in order to return for refund sad they wouldn't swap out product since I emailed them immediately about quality issues.
4123,Battery health was at 80%. If you know anything about iPhones that is when you should replace the battery. This phone was not in excellent condition given this. Maybe fair. But if it needs a new battery idk how it could be listed as excellent.
4124,"I like how it has face recognition, how quickly it moves.  My screen has not froze up."
4125,My daughter loves it!!!
4126,I bought this to replace my 6s and have been pleasantly surprised. The size and weight took some getting used to (to be expected) but everything seems to work well and my black case almost completely hides the red color. A very good product.
4127,"Phone is a 10/10. Had no issues since I purchase back in March of 2020. Had no scratches, dines and shipping was fast. Price was reasonable also.So far so good."
4128,Just what I ordered. Quality is great.
4129,I disliked that my neighbor hacked my phone within a week.  Otherwise it's reasonably easy to use.  Wish I could search for files more easily!
4130,This has worked perfectly for me and I’ve had it for almost 3 months now no problems I love this phone. Definitely worth the buy.
4131,i was very skeptical to order it from amazon after reading all the comments but it came in without any defects and i am very pleased with the phone itself 10/10 would definitely recommend
4132,"Phone is in great shape, camera works great.  Battery lasts two days with normal use."
4133,Came in like 2 days. 90% battery. No scratches. Dude is legit.
4134,"Received phone and went to add to my Verizon account. Phone could not be activated with Verizon. I also have AT&T brought it to them and surprise, works with them. If order a Verizon device, would like to receive a phone that works with Verizon. Also, the phone is very hard to hear people talking when using as a phone. With speaker works fine. Not impressed with this first experience at all."
4135,Still haven’t try battery & cámara! Because it is a present for my daughter but so far perfect! Beautiful cellphone! A lot of complements at cricket store! Brand new ! Doesn’t look refurbished
4136,Good
4137,"I love the phone, but the camera just quit working.  I was going to return it but I tried resetting all everything first.  After resetting all settings the camera now works.  I will have to monitor this carefully before my warranty expires.  The battery life is unbelievably long."
4138,The iPhone XR came in what appears to be new condition(definitely looks brand new). I checked all around the phone throughly and I see no marks at all. 100% satisfied. I got the black model.
4139,Got this for my girlfriend who wanted to switch to iPhone from android. Already loves it. As soon as it came we put her AT&T sim card and the phone was working right away! Definitely would buy again...will update in a week after use!
4140,Great for the price nice quality
4141,Excellent
4142,Very good quality the only thing was shipping on it was very late
4143,"Item defective, touchscreen doesn't work, can't clear personal info."
4144,"Phone came in great condition , and unlocked no issues, everything works perfectly"
4145,"Don’t waste your money. When I’m speaking to someone on the phone, I can barely hear them and the sound is distorted. I can’t be without a phone for weeks and I had so many problems switching my service over that it’s not worth it to send it back. It’s disappointing because I believe the phone was probably returned for the same issue and they just restocked it without fixing the problem. Obviously, they don’t have a quality control process."
4146,"Phone still works and most things were fine, but microphone for Facetime Calling and Speaker phone is very low."
4147,It’s a good phone. I was hesitant but it’s turning out just fine. The battery life is good and it’s just like getting a new phone. I’m not a fan of iPhones but this was given to me as a gift so if you are an iPhone fan you will love this phone especially for the cost
4148,So so happy with this phone. Had it for a year now and have no complaints.
4149,I will get all my iPhones from them..No more paying full price
4150,"the speakers came out defective, everything else looks like new"
4151,Love it theres a scratch where the iphone charging port
4152,"Had the phone just over a month and the battery hasn’t been great since it was opened but I could look past that, there were a couple other small issues but I was overall I was happy.  Then, this morning the screen started glitching with this little circle in the middle that appears to be loading something but nothing ever loads and I can’t use the phone"
4153,"I was expecting few scratches or some sort of used marks, but I was surprised when phone came with perfect condition with 99% battery performance. It also came with new lightening usb and wall cube. I am so satisfied."
4154,I bought this phone for my daughter
4155,the screen came with a scratch
4156,Cant kapp this one of the best purchases I’ve ever made on Amazon I thought this was a scam but I started seeing everyone’s reviews and it was great the phone works great nothings wrong with it came in it looks very brand new
4157,The phone is good. Highly recommended 👍🏼 It’s just like new. It didn’t come with scratches.
4158,Great product but has a nice scratch on the screen but u get what u pay for
4159,Have wearing marks nd drop scratchesBattery 88%Not bad at all on this price..
4160,"It's an iPhone XR from Kiss Electronics.  Really what more can I say?  I purchased mine on Amazon through Kiss Electronics and the phone was in pristine condition, not a single blemish.  Arrived in 2 days!"
4161,Just got the phone works great well worth the money
4162,"Phone looks like new!  I was surprised.  Still checking it out to see if all works.  Battery isn't the best, phone dies very fast."
4163,"Amazing phone, it’s like it’s new. Came in an original iPhone box, with 100% battery life and not a scratch on it! I was skeptical to buy it because of the bad reviews but I’m glad I didn’t listen! I’ve had it for a while now and it doesn’t have any problems at all🙌🏼"
4164,Arrived early. Packaging was great! Phone looks like new. Set up like a new phone. Phone is working great. Been using it for several weeks now and no problems.
4165,The phones are exactly what I wanted but the accessories don’t really work with them but all in all satisfied
4166,Phone won’t connect to Apple Watch but other then that works fine
4167,"Cons: It had a little scratches at the top of the screen. Price is almost as new but it isn't new.Pros: Battery capacity 95% which is good, but you may get 80%."
4168,"Phone was like new except the volumn of the ring tones are not as loud as my old Iphone 6.  Since it is usually blue tooth connected to my hearing aids, that is a very minor problem."
4169,Just what I wanted and expected ❤️
4170,Fast delivery and the phone arrived in good condition.Everything works well.
4171,This IS legit! Great product at half the price of brand new: NEVER buy brand new!
4172,Was nervous about ordering a renewed phone but it arrived in great shape except just a couple scratches on the back other than those the phone is in perfect shape and has 93% battery health
4173,Good quality not broken fully unlocked would recommend works just fine
4174,me gusto todo
4175,Phone is in fantastic condition works great. Unlocked. Metro PCS turn it right on. Ordered another one.
4176,Seller was very friendly and understanding and resolved my issue within days . Highly recommended
4177,I had my reserves about this new way to deliver products but amazon Renewed over up my expectations.
4178,"Most the bad reviews are because they were expecting a charger and earphones. I love the phone, no need to spend money on a brand new one 🤷🏼‍♀️"
4179,A really great phone and the price was Evan better
4180,Definitely fast delivery and phone is working great.
4181,The best money I’ve ever spent on a phone.
4182,The phone battery is amazing! My map is kind of difficult to use. It keeps saying that my location is turned off when in fact it’s on. I took it to the apple store and they fixed it super fast!! Other than that I had no issues and the phone works perfect !
4183,Pretty good overall. I haven’t had any issues thankfully.
4184,I was very skeptical at first but this is the best thing I've ever done!! You will not regret it!
4185,Works super
4186,"I am telling you this is  cheap and the best deal. When I got it it came with a brand new original charger and the phone is awesome great battery life, no scratches."
4187,I was a little unsure at first but now I can say this produce is definitely worth it.
4188,I like the presentation of the cell phone.I dislike the fact I don’t find the Manuel of information
4189,"Phone came with a charger, case and glass screen protector. The phone came fast and perfect."
4190,I really like the colour of this phone. It came packaged really well and had a full battery health!
4191,"No issues thus far , good battery life with barely noticeable scratches on screen."
4192,The package came very early no damage on the outside of the screen and with the warranty it really is a no risk option very good seller.
4193,"Works perfectly for a great price. Does have a dead pixel spot, but barely noticeable and we’ll worth the cost savings. It did take awhile to get here."
4194,It came with a lot of dents and a lot of scratches. The battery life was at 92 which is okay. Just the scrathes and dents messed up the order.
4195,I absolutely love this phone was skeptical at first but it’s recommended
4196,Bought for my mom she loves this phone works really great great battery life
4197,"A month after receiving the phone, the audio began giving problems. During calls, the sound will be muted. Not only that but also during apps usage (facebook, tik-tok), the sound will be muted also."
4198,I was so excited to get the phone for my daughter it came and it looked great the battery life was great everything went well until we went to charge it we tried Apple cords we tried the cord it came with we tried about 10 different cords and it will not charge the only way will charge is if it sits on a charging pad so clearly the port needs to be replaced so they sent me a phone that won’t even charge by the port so they must not inspect these as well as they say they do hoping the seller contact me so I can get a different one because it not convenient to have a phone the only charges by charging pad. Stinks I got the phone all set up a screen protector on it and i need a different one I was nervous to buy a used phone off of Amazon
4199,Good camera!This is my second XR. I used it as a back up phone
4200,I love this phone. Works great and impressed how brand new it is. Highly recommended.
4201,This phone is amazing! Exactly like the photos shown!
4202,I had this phone for at least 3 months and it’s working amazing I will most definitely be shopping with them again
4203,"Honestly, I knew what I was buying. Although, this phone looked like it was dropped a multiple times. Just know that yours could come with scratches on the side or back."
4204,This phone is so nice.  It was just as promised and arrived on time.  I was happy with this purchase!
4205,"I ordered this phone as a xmas gift to myself.  I had a very hard time hearing on the phone, to the point that I actually made an appointment with an ENT specialist.  I was convinced I was suffering from hearing loss.  After a clean bill of health, I realized the problem was with the phone.  I could hear fine if using the speaker function, but couldn't hear if the phone was held up to my ear.  I took the phone to the Apple authorized service center and was told there was a problem with both internal speakers and that I would have to send it off to Apple for repair for a whopping cost of $490.  I recognized this was a ""renewed"" phone when I purchased it, but they apparently didn't address the issue with the internal speakers.  I reached out to the seller who informed me my request was outside of the warranty period.  Now I'm stuck with having to use the phone only on speaker function which  is extremely inconvenient for me (total loss of privacy) and disturbing to those around me"
4206,I love my new phone
4207,Love It
4208,I had to change my service completely after I bought a fully unlocked for any provider phone. If I didn’t expect something like this to happen I would have just bought the one for my service provider. I did the homework so you don’t have to DO NOT BUY  unless you want a discounted phone that might potentially take your service provider
4209,The phone arrived with the back glass shattered and part of the screen doesn't work at the top. Do not buy this phone.
4210,"Very disappointed! The phone works great as it is my first iphone so im still getting used to it but i gave it 2 stars because the item said fully refurbished and ""like new"" but this thing is covered in scratches! It looks like some kid played with his new knife on the screen and the back has this long ugly scratch. I would return it but seeing as how im Stationed in Okinawa Japan i dont want to wait the month plus that it took to reach out here. Good product but very disappointed in the quality."
4211,Love this phone it takes AMAZING photos and videos! Battery last a full day with lots of use! The only thing I wasn’t happy with is it came fedex other then that I am extremely happy and would recommend!
4212,I was skeptical buying this phone but I’m happy I did! The phone looks brand new and so far I haven’t had any issues!  The battery is at 94% but that is fine with me.
4213,Great phone! First time buying a refurbished phone. So glad I did!
4214,It works perfectly
4215,Came with a few scratches. Sometimes the screen lags but I think that’s an Apple thing. Otherwise perfectly fine and works like new.
4216,Around the camera lens came very scuff. Battery came at 88%. Everything else works perfectly. For being 300 dollars I can not complain.
4217,"the phone came in perfect condition and unlocked, no scratches found m, would highly recommend"

4230,I like this product
4231,"Best iPhone I’ve had. Works great. Had iPhone 8 and it was awful. This phone never has bad reception, is fast and overall great. Maybe it’s because I didn’t buy it from AT&T. Every single phone I’ve ever purchased from them has had issues so I now doubt it’s Apple."
4232,"Phone has weird issues like when I plug in adapter piece Siri automatically comes on twice or three times. It hangs up on people all the time, it freezes on apps. It has a small scratch. But it works and is what I was looking for."
4233,IMEI is reported as lost therefore i cannot use it. It’s literally garbage. Waste of money.
4234,"Great all around, no problems, fully unlocked. Put your straight talk sim in and your set."
4235,"Wonderful purchase. Was afraid at first to spend this much on a renewed item, but product came in mint condition no scratched no scuffs. Didn't come with originally charger but that's fine; also came with 2 FREE screen protectors. All in all great purchase."
4236,the battery life on the first week was amazing but now it’s not as good. but it still stays charged. it takes forever to charge tho i have noticed that. i do recommend getting the xr
4237,"My first iPhone in over a decade, and it’s really a good starter phone."
4238,The phone came just as it was shown. There are no scratches or anything it looks brand new. It also works really well and i had no issues transferring my sim and data over.
4239,I upgraded from long term iPhone 6. Much like MY new phone.
4240,The phone works and there’s no visible marks.
4241,Works amazing even better then I thought I would buy it again without any hesitations.
4242,This phone came to me in perfect condition I am so happy with it

4247,ireally like the phone but there is some scratchs in screen an the metal of the phone is not perf) but there is free case
4248,It’s prefect and it came on time I love my new phone and the battery is great
4249,Battery life- battery needs charging more often then it should
4250,"Excellent quality !!! It worked well in Colombia, South America"

4255,I like the delivery time
4256,iPhone XR is pretty great and fast enough I love it. Save battery all day long.
4257,I love the size of the phone! That was a big thing for me when I was looking for a phone to buy. I dislike how long it took for me to set everything upBut that isn’t a big deal.
4258,Bought this for a birthday gift to my daughter and she loves it ! Package came on time and in mint condition! Great price !! Setup was a breeze the phone does all the work!!!

4265,Phone randomly crashes
4266,Not a problem came almost like brand new 😂 was a little nervous
4267,All I can I say is thank you. Phone came in two days early. Fast process but didn’t really trust it at first but if you need it then you gotta get it
4268,When I opened the box I thought there was a mistake this was a brand new phone. Many weeks later a noticed an extremely small scratch but aside from that everything was great.
4269,Was able to get it up and going in seconds.  Accepted AT&T sim card with no issue.  Great phone.  I originally paid more than 1K for one. This was a much better deal and was as good as new.
4270,It came fast and was super easy to set up and came with a charger and screen protector already put on!! Has a few scratches but works like new! I 100% recommend to buy.
4271,Had this just over a year and now it no longer connects to WiFi or cell service. Took it to get fixed and it cost me almost as much as the phone to get a new antenna for the phone.
4272,Phone is legit and it’s worth the price paying. Battery life is 100% and connect perfectly to phone service.
4273,"phones were in very good condition, with no issues so far"
4274,"Phone works perfectly , great product !"
4275,Its ok a little scartch but other than tht it’s ok
4276,"My phone seems to have a small virus, it freezes sometimes."
4277,If you have the money this is the way to go. I bought myself a new iPhone XR from AT&T and will end up paying almost 2.5 times more.Ordered this for my 12 year old and she’s in love.
4278,It’s a great iPhone I have given it my Daughter for Christmas this year
4279,"Main bad issue is that while watching videos, sometimes there comes green lines for a second, other things are good"
4280,This is my second time buying an iPhone off amazon. The first time I was a little skeptical but both times the phones were great. Not to mention the prices are good too.
4281,I highly Recommend This My Phone Came Quick Screen Has No Cracks No scratches And Brand New Battery I Love My Red IPhone XR and It Comes With Brand New Charger Just No headphones
4282,I love Iphones so each one I buy is awesome and better

4284,I really like this phone once im starting to figure out all out!
4285,really excellent quality. Although I do have to say sellers are very important so make sure the seller is legit and has good reviews.

4293,"Battery life is 90%, not bad. Love the phone, no scratches, almost like new."
4294,The product works as advertised. No problems whatsoever. Included was the charging brick and wire as well as a screen protector but no headphones.

4299,El producto llegó en excelentes condiciones
4300,"Bought a renewed premium unlocked black XR. Looked great when it came out of the box. Placed sim card in properly…nothing happened. Took it to T-Mobile, still didn’t work. They tried a new sim card, still wouldn’t work. It wasn’t locked, it wasn’t giving any normal alerts to an issue, it just wouldn’t work. Such a hassle. I wouldn’t waste your time or money."
4301,Exactly what it said it was works great
4302,My stepdaughter loved no issues just like new
4303,"Came in perfect condition, battery life at 97% brand new iPhone"
4304,This was a christmas gift for my son and he loves it. And was so happy
4305,I bought an XR with BuySpry and it came with a new battery and in good condition.
4306,What I dislike is the left speaker that doesn’t work but it’s still good quality! I’m assuming these are used refurbished phones! Which I’ve been purchasing refurbished phones over the past two years and they work GREAT!!
4307,"Me vino malo el touch screen, debo cambiarlo pues el lado derecho falla mucho."
4308,Everything is working in perfect condition! Thank you guys so much go caring about customer needs!!!❤️

4310,I love everything about the phone I wrote a bad review at first but I had everything resolved so I’m coming back to update my review the phone works perfect like new and it looks new !!!!
4311,Received my IPhone as expected. Well packed (not the original box) and in very good condition. Battery life was well above 90%. No complaints !
4312,Phone came early as expected great condition
4313,Completely disatisfied. I am a note 10+ user and wanted to finally try a iPhone. My wife had order a iPhone for herself from the regular note 10 and our some wanted the iPhone 8 the had been loving it so I decided to try the xr and order to try out first before I decided to join the 11 pro line up. Well I spent 7 hours transferring all my data over and once finished I heard my wife playing music on her phone in the other room and was like wow that sounds loud let me turn my phone music on. Then I was disappointed. I found out my speaker was broken I thought it was maybe volumnlow or in eq setting well went through all setting different music players nope same same. Then I had her call my phone and I realized I could barley hear her on the other end through the ear piece she had to tell for me to hear her. This is upsetting. Had to send phone back and left a bad taste in my mouth I had alot of Android phones and never had any problem with speakers on them at all.
4314,"Don't waste your money on buying a phone from the apple store,BUY ONE ON AMAZON!This phone is amazing,works just as well as the ones from apple.I LOVE IT!"
4315,At first I was scared cause of the bad reviews but the phone is just as new . In the description it says it doesn’t come with earphones . Also I put my SIM card in and everything and the phone is great
4316,This is a g reat phone I just wish it would’ve came with better battery life. But the phone works great!
4317,Muy buenoo
4318,Battery life great
4319,Exactly what I wanted just a little dash cant see but it works perfectly good battery was on 90$

4321,I am happy to have bought this device instead of a brand new one
4322,The touch screen is not to friendly.Specially to people with arthritis
4323,It’s amazing i love it
4324,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and she was very happy.
4325,"This phone was absolutely amazing aside from the rear camera glitch. It never wanted to work. You have to expect that sometimes things can go wrong when purchasing refurbished, but they were SUPER nice about it all and refunded me promptly. Had the camera worked, I’d totally give five stars."
4326,"Great phone with great battery life, my only gripe was the phone had no charge upon arrival"

4340,"Absolutely beautiful thank you so much! Please buy from this seller, they’re very trustworthy."

4350,Definitely glad with my productAnd it arrived 4 days EARLY!
4351,"I did my due diligence and researched several options before I committed to a renewed IPhone XR from the Amazon. I had high hopes and really needed an unlocked new(er) phone. And you would think with so many positive reviews, this was the real deal. WRONG!!! The phone arrived nicely packaged with a slight scratch on the side. Not a big deal at all, because separately I purchased a nice case for it. The screen was also nice with no visible scratches. I’m addition, I attached a screen protector. So the phone performed flawlessly for about two months. I loved how responsive it was. And then out of the blue, I receive the following settings message: “Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery. Health information not available for this battery.” SAY WHAT? The phone started automatically shutting off and restarting. You’re in the middle of writing an email, and boom the phone shuts off. Lovely. The battery indicator said it’s completely drained, but it really isn’t. Waste of time. Highly disappointed and will send it back tomorrow for a refund."
4352,"Screen glitches here and there, comes with scratches that’s noticeable."
4353,Overall nice phone. Bought renewed but haven’t encountered any issues with this as of yet
4354,Phone came in nearly perfect condition. There are no visible bumps or bruises. Battery is at 99%. So far so good!

4356,"Perfectly as described. I couldn’t see any cosmetic wear(scratches, cracks, etc...). The battery life is at 100%, and it really looked and worked like brand new. It’s definitely worth the money. Came with a charger and charging block. Couldn’t ask for a better deal"
4357,This phone is awesome!  As far as iPhones go I recommend it
4358,Everything is good! Battery life is A1 and screen quality is great
4359,Reading the reviews made me make my decision for ordering the phone it came unlocked speakers fine not cracked and a screen protector already on it it came right before I got home I recommend buying this
4360,PERFECT condition!! Didn’t come with any of the original gear but the phone itself looks like it just came from the box. Put my SIM card in and it worked like a charm.

4436,I was not a good phone the speakers and microphone broke within the first month and I ordered black and got red.
4437,Battery life is really bad....
4438,"Phone purchased January 1, 2022 and gained access January 14th, 2022.Phone speaker started malfunction less than a  months. Freezes then restart on random occasions. Phone Jailbreaking not unlocked not to mention only 4 apps download (Utube, tiktok, utube studio & whatsapp) yet still phone says memory full for a 64g.Dialing is also an issue as by dialing 1# it sounds as if your 10 numbers.I would not recommend"
4439,"The phone is practically new!! No scratches, good battery life and everything is working fine !! 20/10"
4440,"I got my phone in December and since I’ve gotten it, the phone call speaker has not worked at all, it’s very quiet. I thought it was a problem with my ears since my previous phone had a similar issue and I didn’t expect a new phone to have a problem, but it’s my fault for not returning the phone at that time. But the phone is disfunctional"
4441,The touch screen has lots of scratches some of them very deep.Over all I give the  phone 3 stars.
4442,"I'm very disappointed, this brand-new looking phone shuts off minutes after taking it off the charge, often times when fully charged! Saving up money to buy a legit phone from Verizon -- I tried to cut costs, but this isn't worth it."
4443,Ordered 2 phones. Worked as soon we put our SIM cards in and turned them on. Nearly perfect!
4444,Hasta ahora funciona muy bien.Sólo tenía algunos rasguños pero sigue funcionando hasta ahora.
4445,The screen had scratches on there but everything works fine .
4446,This phone was absolutely flawless and perfect  Thank you

4460,"The screen is very very scratched I'm guessing that's why it came with a screen protector on it.  After further inspection, it also has dents and scratches on the edges of the phone and back, and camera. I'm a little surprised that this is Amazon reviewed."

4493,"Bastante decepcionado, la pantalla con muy baja calidad y por las orillas con muchos detalles"
4494,The phone was in really good condition just a few scratches but I love it !!
4495,Great product. Great condition!!
4496,"This product came in excellent condition! I was apprehensive, as I haven’t purchased a refurbished phone prior to this, but the iPhone was perfect! It runs well and there is no damage at all to the body. The speakers work great and it runs so well. This was an amazing purchase."
4497,This was bought as a gift so I have not used it myself. I have not received any complaints and if their had been any issues I would have been informed.  I chose this company because of competitive pricing.
4498,"I purchased this phone exactly six months ago, and the screen digitizer has already gone bad. The cost of fixing the issue isn’t much less than buying a new phone. After asking the seller for a refund or a replacement, I was told I’m beyond my 90 days and they will do nothing for me. For what I paid for this phone, I don’t understand why they do not stand behind it. If I had dropped it or broke it I could understand, but to just have a phone go bad for no reason? They should give me some sort of a replacement, prorate the cost toward a new phone, or do something. Instead, they said they will do nothing for me. I strongly recommend you do not buy products from this seller."
4499,Its like new 100% new just in a different boxNo scratches at all
4500,I bought my husband this phone & it died on him within a year. No screen cracks or water damage. It just suddenly started tweaking a lot & died.
4501,"The phone I received was not unlocked: I received it sufficiently charged to see that it was functioning, so I did not doubt it was unlocked. I brought it overseas as a gift fir a friend, but when it got eventually uncharged I was not able to turn it back on, as it required a passcode. I had to hire a tech guy and pay him $120 to hack into the phone and delete the passcode. Once that was done, all the information from its previous owner was still in the phone, including all the contacts, photos, etc. It took over an hour to delete all and restore the phone to factory settings. Since i was overseas for a couple of months I was not able to return it but I'm really frustrated that I had to pay an extra $120 to make it work"
4502,My lil brother loves it 🧡
4503,"great phone, better than expected, recomended."
4504,Phone came with battery health of 100%! That was the only thing I was worried about. Because Amazon Renewed only guaranteed “at least 80%”.Also there are no signs of cosmetic wear on my phone.
4505,Awesome! Love it!
4506,Screen is very easy to break so make sure you put it in a good phone case.
4507,Phone came water damage but nearly noticed it
4508,Do NOT buy this phone. I just received it today and while I was setting it up it completely glitched out and made a password that now I cannot get into the phone. This is a hacker. Definitely am returning this today. Really disappointing.
4509,Originally It Was Supposed To Come On The 8th (Which Is Monday). But It Came A Few Days Earlier Than I Had Expected It Too 😁
4510,"I got sprayed by the sprinklers and the phone was dead. Refurbished, but not very well done."
4511,"I've had this phone for 2 days and I've had nothing but issues. First one being that it didn't even come with an apple charger. The reviews I read before buying said it did. The charger works but it takes all day to charge and you can forget about using it while plugged in because the percentage goes down. There were scratches and chips on the outside of phone. The worst of it all is that I physically can't use it. I'm on my old phone typing this review, because my new phone is unusable. The touchscreen is off or something and it picks and chooses when it wants to work. I've had issues writing a simple text or going to my contacts and searching someone. Even trying to just enter my code. It jumps around and goes crazy like it has a mind of it's own. I've restarted it several times, made sure it didnt need an update (because it is a used phone) still nothing. I am very frustrated that I spent 500 dollars on a phone that simply doesnt work. Hopefully I have no problems returning it."
4512,Bigger size versus old phone. Touch screen.
4513,The battery 🔋 life it’s amazing ..... it came with a screen protector
4514,There are no visible scratches on it! It looks as if it was new. I've had it for 2 weeks and it works great and I had no problems. Definitely worth it
4515,"Awesome phone, I thought I would take a chance and buying it!!! Glad I took that chance because this phone is practically brand new and I love it!!!!"
4516,"The phone was great but now after a few months having trouble with ringer goes to silence every time I turn around, very frustrating and the volume isn't very  loud"
4517,"Sorry I'm late making this review.  The phone came in perfect condition.  I waited to see if there would be any late issues,there has not. I'm very satisfied with this purchase, I will purchase again in the future."
4518,"I like it, but it had many scratches on it."
4519,Love this thank you

4526,"My phone is in absolutely perfect condition. I debated buying the phone straight from Apple for some time because a few people had left negative reviews. However, I took the risk because of the price and am so glad I did. I've had it for over 2 weeks and everything works to a charm."

4530,I got the bar as a gift for my son and he says it’s the best phone he’s had so far After three months he is still saying thank you for the phone
4531,This phone is not at all a disappointment! It is absolutely perfect and works like a new phone. It came in an apple generated box which led me to believe it was brand new. No scratches or any setbacks. I recommend this phone to people who need good battery life and tons of features.
4532,Screen and phone came in perfect condition. Speakers are loud are work amazingly.
4533,"Absolutely Love this phone ! iPhone is Refurbished however it Looks like in new condition no problem at all , Love the Camera , doesn’t come with original charger"

There are stains around the camera lens in the back, which can't be removed with anything I have tried, it's like sap. It has noticeable scratches and marks in several parts. This is a huge disappointment, I just assumed that Amazon Refurbished would be of high quality. What a joke."

4719,I loved the phone it was amazing it came so fast 5 days before the actual date I will order it all over again if I could 😃
4720,The phone is great but the speaker system not so much. You cannot hear the person you are on the phone with and if your watching a video or playing music the speakers sound like there about to explode and you can’t make out the words. I want to send it back for a replacement but I’ve already sold my old iPhone 7. If you could send me a replacement so I wouldn’t be without a phone for 2-4 weeks while waiting in the carrier to ship this one back and then bring a new one that would be awsome. I’m no thief so I can assure you you’d get this piece a junk back. If not. No sweat I’ll make it work but I’ll buy from someone else in the future. Thank you and god bless
4721,Worked perfectly
4722,This is not a scam! The phone is in amazing condition for (USED). Almost brand new would recommend this to anyone and buy with confidence.

4727,"I was skeptical buying a new phone online and especially a renewed one, but it was worth it. The phone arrived a week early looking brand new and works perfectly. They were super nice and added an apple charger and a high quality screen protector for free. Thanks guys 👍"
4728,Definitely would recommend phone came in perfect shape but I see some post saying it does not come with earbuds it also says that in the description
4729,"The phone arrived as it shoudl. Very good quality, battery life is new. It has a little scratch on the screen and something weird on the screen but apart from that the phone is great. I totally recomend."
4730,Love my new phone it’s camera works okay. Volume is amazing. It was deliver on time I’m thankful.

4753,"Do not get scammed like I did there is a reason these phones cost less than getting one from Apple.  They say the phone is unlocked which at first I thought meant there was no passcode, but I was mistaken.  My original SIM card is not compatible with the phone I received.  You are basically buying an IPod that you can't use without the internet.  I remember telling my sister I saved so much money from buying a ""Refurbished"" phone and she told me it was probably a scam in some way.  I should've listened, going to return this phone, hopefully they don't give me a hard time.  Sometimes things are too good to be true, lesson learned..."
4754,Phone works perfectly and came on time
4755,"I like this iPhone XR, great product for network."
4756,Perfect
4757,Too new to rate.
4758,Purchased phone In May of this year. Phone died December 24th. 7 months of use.  Motherboard issue.
4759,"Just received product for review but the phone itself appears to be in excellent condition, like brand new."
4760,Love it works great! Great quality perfect condition
4761,Great service fast delivery my iPhone XR came practically brand new as if I bought it out the store. I am very happy with my purchase! ☺️Thank you for a wonderful product!
4762,My daughter saved her money to buy a new phone. She couldn’t afford one from Verizon so we took a chance on amazon.  It was like brand new when it arrived.
4763,Excellent overall
4764,"I’m new to iPhone, although I have an iPad,so I am still learning the details with the phone! The set up was easy, and the phone is cool...so far so good! No complaints!"
4765,The phone was as expected. I was happy with the purchase!
4766,It was fully unlocked I loved it.
4767,I love the color and quality of the phone. The seller was quick with the shipment and I have no complaints about the phone.

4771,It literally an iPhone I love it perfect
4772,This phone is great I was a spectacle at first but once I started using the phone everything works perfect great phone
4773,Beautiful phone but - Could not get it microphone/voice  to work after several hours of reboot/blue tooth off/on/resets and sim card changes I upset everyone I tried to call as they could not hear me- no one at vendor to chat or help resolve- vendor returned emailed me after I already returned iPhone.  I worked with my phone service provider to check out sim card(s) not there- No help available.  I may have been unlucky but glad Amazon returned product.
4774,Excelent
4775,It arrived early and in great condition! I’m really happy that the battery life was at 96% as well so it should be good for a long time!
4776,Fast delivery. It came in just 5 days (3 days earlier than the expected delivery date) and i’m loving my new phone so far! ❤️
4777,I couldn’t be happier. Like a brand new phone! Great price.
4778,Looks brand new and came fast
4779,All functions work properly
4780,I was waiting and ok screen but this one was a very bad screen with a lot of stripes on the screen. I was not able to return because I travel so I really don’t like the cellphone
4781,This meets my needs
4782,It was amazing. Came in just like new. I expected something sketchy but it was amazing and they have some extra things that come with it which is always a plus.
4783,She loved it and it works good too
4784,10/10 :)
4785,This phone was sold and the speakers are not working properly. The ear speaker sounds muffled and the other is blown. This should have been disclosed.
4786,The phone came in perfect condition no scratches or anything so far everything is as in description and it might not come with original charger or headphones but the phone is worth the money paid BUT IT DID NOT COME UNLOCK
4787,"Boy, it sure is a good thing Amazon cares about customer satisfaction. I had to immediately order a replacement after having multiple glitches with installing IOS and setting the phone up, only to discover that the top speaker of the phone was completely blown out. So much so to the point where no call audio was understandable, and the alarms sounded horrible and crackly. It was honestly so disappointing. The phone came with no dents or scratches but is unusable if you plan to make any calls. My battery health came at 94%. The only redeeming quality of the transaction was Amazon’s customer service being very quick to replace my product I paid $530 for. They were wonderful and I’m very impressed with the help they provided. They even expedited shipping for me, which I found to be very kind. I give it one star since the actual product literally wasn’t functional, but the customer service provided by amazon got 5 stars. Hopefully my replacement actually works."
4788,Battery life
4789,The phone is ok but the audio is very low when im on a call . I have to keep  putting it on speaker
4790,I love my new phone! Very happy with this purchase!
4791,The phone I received was like a brand new phone. Works perfect & have no complaints
4792,The phone itself came in perfect condition and it was basically brand new BUT when I tried to place my sim card in and get it working it would not work at all. I went to my carriers store and when they tried they told me my phone was either blacklisted or it was not carrier unlocked (even tho it says the phone is carrier unlocked on amazon). So if you plan on buying this i’d be very cautious about it and just buy it from your carrier or from the apple store.
4793,Nothing
4794,It’s beautiful it looks actually brand new not a scratch on it
4795,More scratches than phone.
4796,Didn't have any issues migrating to our new phone

4810,It was a great phone and great price and battery health was 100% . Very satisfied worth the money
4811,Couple little scratches on the screen but good overall.
4812,Love the color. Phone works perfect. Had one ding on corner like it had been dropped. But does not effect the phone.
4813,Bad seller - sold defective iphone XR and wants to charge shipping to return item for refund
4814,"screen came cracked and popped out of frame and needed a lot of pressure to work. ignored, and now phone screen ungluing & half of the keyboard portion of the screen (about 1/6 of the phone) straight up doesn’t work. among the worst purchases i’ve ever made."

4840,Everything is great no issues at all
4841,"After (just) 3 month the refurbish device went cold. Is not turning on, Apple representative told me that is not fixable (not powering on). And the seller would not consider any option. HollyCow”! I would never consider buying again Apple devices from anyone except Apple store directly. By looking at $50 discount I lost $450 first time and I’ll need to spend another ~ $500 for a new iPhone XR.When I bought this devise on Amazon, I thought that this iPhone is sold as new, the “refurbished” word was hidden, hard to see. If Apple representative would not show me, I would not even know that it was refurbished.Personally, I would never again buy anything from this company, is not trustworthy, the info that is on Amazon posted about this product was misleading."
4842,It would be nice to have headphones and also to have a better description.
4843,As expected. Great produxt
4844,Only 3 months into having my phone it stop working

I live in Israel and its not that I can sent it back right away so I waited to see if it will be better with time,  and I ignore the small problem but sure enough now a few months later its not working at all. The screen is not responding at all just like that. its not damage or anything. I am very disappointed by this seller. also he is not responding as I try contacting him when I find out its not an original apple screen. and he never answer me."

4935,The phone came with alot of scratches on the screen..definitely not happy about that
4936,"My phone came in perfect condition, in an Apple box with a charger and cord , just as advertised.  It arrived 4 days earlier than scheduled and has worked well so far but I have had it only a week.  Love the face recognition."

4963,Thank you it came really fast and nice clean

4965,"The phone functioned and worked as designed.  No scratches, dents or cosmetic defects.  Having an issue with the mic on the device, callers are saying they can not hear me because my voice was going in and out.  Will be returning this device to purchase another and hopefully the mic on that device is working."
4966,Great reliable phone
4967,good condition no scratches

4972,Great 10\10 battery max compacity was 91% I would buy this phone again
4973,More dinged and scratched than anticipated
4974,I can’t rate the battery quality or face recognition because as soon as I saw the phone I put it back in the box. The phone was beat to death. It looked like the previous owner had never used a screen protector and left the phone in their pocket with a live gerbal and loose change. The one good thing I can say is that the company had great communication! I decided to pay the extra $200 for a new phone than settle. I expected a lot better quality.
4975,"This phone was beautiful when I received it, looked and worked like new. I recommend seller ChubbiesTech due to their fast shipping, great customer service and item quality."
4976,"I liked everything, came unlocked .. but it did come dead but I’m not complaining .. charger and box included. Didn’t come with headphones. And safely and neatly wrapped"

4980,This whole product is ass
4981,So far this product has exceeded expectations. I was hesitant buying a used phone but it’s turned out to be really acceptable for a lot less money
4982,Horrible I brought this phone listening to the good reviews and giving it a chance it came beautiful but after 3 days the screen stopped working got it fixed now the volume ain't working I'm over it I wish I would jus got a android cause every other min it's a problem  DONT BUY THIS PHONE
4983,"The speaker (for hearing on calls) is extremely low for the device I received . It is clearly a defect , one that is actually a major issue in a phone. Outside of that the phone is what you’d expect"
4984,Just as advertised
4985,"This phone was beautiful, in great condition, no discernible flaws. I would definitely recommend to anyone to try Amazon Refurbished products. This is my 3-4th time I have bought a refurbished product and not once have I been disappointed."

4988,Good product
4989,I love it
4990,Good backup phone if you ever break your nice phone. There was some scratches on the back and slight damaged to the bottom. The battery will need to be replaced but other than that it’s okay. Not worth the price.
4991,"The battery life is amazing, and the phone is fast as I could ever want! Totally love the phone"
4992,I was worried that the phone wouldn’t work very well but I got it anyways and it works great! Mine seem like new but it’s so much cheaper than buying a new one. It came with a charger and sim tool

4998,I was lukewarm about buying this phone but I absolutely love it looks brand new I would definitely recommend
4999,"It’s safe just buy it( I bought it after saving money from my summer job, I’m 16 years old, this isn’t a scam, works easily with metro pcs)"
